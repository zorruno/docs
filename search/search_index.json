It was a fancy plastic-thingy with voice-recording-function & programmable to feed several times a day after playing back your voice (cats don't give a sh$7 about your voice - they come when they hear the food falling into the bowl). It was never precise - a concern for the amount of nutrition it gave the cats. And it was not reliable, as the torque of the internal moving mechanism was insufficient to spin the separator/proportioning wheel through the food reliably. In addition, the batteries were always drained in a day meaning very grumpy cats when we returned! Thus the wish to install a high-torque stepper-motor (with shifting gear) was born. I could power it with mains instead of relying on a battery, control it over WiFi from my home automation hub. Tasmota now offers a way to do this! The \"TasmotaSmartCatFeeder\" circuit consists of a WeMos D1 mini, a A4988 controller, and two power supplies (5V&12V). This all fits into the housing of the feeder and costs less than 50\u20ac!

It may be used to read voltage at ADC pin or to read module supply voltage (VCC). Note When referring to the ADC pin these terms are used interchangeably: ADC (Analog-to-digital Converter), TOUT, Pin6, A0 or Analog0. Warning Check your Wi-Fi module! The ESP8266 A0 pin supports a maximum voltage of 1.0V. Many newer Wi-Fi modules have an on-board voltage divider to support a higher A0 input voltage range (typically in the range between 0 and 3.3 volts). You may need to use an external voltage divider to ensure your input voltage is in the right range. By default Tasmota uses the ADC pin to read voltage. The signal comes from an analog peripheral , or sometimes from the device itself (see Shelly 2.5 ). After wiring a peripheral to A0 pin you have to configure it in Configure Module : # Option WebUI display MQTT mesage 0 None none none 1 Analog Analog0 %value% {\"A0\":%value%} 2 Temperature Temperature %value% \u00b0C (\u00b0F) {\"Temperature\":%value%},\"TempUnit\":\"C\"} 3 Light Illuminance %value% lux {\"Illuminance\":%value%} 4 Button none none 5 Buttoni none none 6 Range Range %value% {\"Range\":%value%} 7 CT Power Voltage 230 V Current %value A Power %value W Energy Total %value kWh {\"Energy\":_%value_,\"Power\":_%value_,\"Voltage\":230,\"Current\":_%value_} The reading will show in web UI's sensor section as \" %option% %value% \" depending on the selected option.

We have at least one case report, where this led to a malfunction on an ESP8266-board within Tasmota but in another library too. The exact technical reason can only be suspected, but it is probably related to electrical noise and/or power consumption. In the case from above the sensor measured an incorrect high proximity value, which resulted in repeated triggering of a \"LONG\" gesture. The solution was to decrease the gain factor for proximity and gesture. Therefore the argument 2 ( sensor27 2 ) was introduced to change this at runtime. If you experience gesture sensing problems you could try this out, but if you measure proximity values <25 with nothing in front of the sensor (e.g. web interface after sensor27 0 ), then there is very likely another problem. It can be assumed, that the gesture sensitivity will suffer with reduced gain, so first try option 1 (=default). Beside that better wiring and maybe an additional capacitor over VCC and GROUND might be helpful. The measurement of the light level is briefly described in the datasheet and the open-source-libraries use the ambient-light-value directly from the sensor or calculate a LUX-value from RGB. Both variants are usable and differentiate between low and strong light, but the absolute values are questionable and at the moment we have an uncalibrated sensor. All known solutions use a fixed integration time, which is more or less the same as a fixed exposure time in photography. In contrast the TSL2561-library uses various integration times and maybe this is possible on the APDS9960 too. To eventually achieve this in the future, the option to set this integration time at runtime was added. Every argument between 3 and 255 sets the ATIME-register. The formula is: integration time = (256-ATIME) 2,78 ms, so with the default value of 219 we get (256-219) 2,78 = 102,86 ms. That means a smaller ATIME makes the integration time longer and more photons are captured, which might be usable for (very) low light conditions, because otherwise the sensor will saturate too early. The opposite is valid for a bigger ATIME value. The change of this value only makes sense for: users who need to change the sensitivity, if the sensor resides behind dark glass or want to contribute to the development of a new LUX-calculation in the driver. If we get enough feedback, this could lead to an improvement on the software side. Feel free to open (or search for) an issue, if you have measured the APDS9960 against other devices with different ATIME-values at different light levels. This is not a trivial task though.

In addition, the integrated UV-IR blocking filter enables accurate ambient light and correlated color temperature sensing.","title":"APDS-9960 light and gesture sensor"},{"location":"APDS-9960/#configuration","text":"","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"APDS-9960/#commands","text":"Command Value Description Sensor27 Show APDS9960 gesture/RGBC mode Sensor27 0 / off Disable APDS9960 gesture mode/Enable RGBC mode Sensor27 1 / on Enable APDS9960 gesture mode/Disable RGBC mode Sensor27 2 / on Enable APDS9960 gesture mode/Disable RGBC mode with half gain Sensor27 3 ...255 Set ATIME register for different integration times","title":"Commands"},{"location":"APDS-9960/#example-rules","text":"Device will be in RGBC mode until something is close to it, then it switches into gesture mode for 60 seconds.

We have at least one case report, where this led to a malfunction on an ESP8266-board within Tasmota but in another library too. The exact technical reason can only be suspected, but it is probably related to electrical noise and/or power consumption. In the case from above the sensor measured an incorrect high proximity value, which resulted in repeated triggering of a \"LONG\" gesture. The solution was to decrease the gain factor for proximity and gesture. Therefore the argument 2 ( sensor27 2 ) was introduced to change this at runtime. If you experience gesture sensing problems you could try this out, but if you measure proximity values <25 with nothing in front of the sensor (e.g. web interface after sensor27 0 ), then there is very likely another problem. It can be assumed, that the gesture sensitivity will suffer with reduced gain, so first try option 1 (=default). Beside that better wiring and maybe an additional capacitor over VCC and GROUND might be helpful. The measurement of the light level is briefly described in the datasheet and the open-source-libraries use the ambient-light-value directly from the sensor or calculate a LUX-value from RGB. Both variants are usable and differentiate between low and strong light, but the absolute values are questionable and at the moment we have an uncalibrated sensor. All known solutions use a fixed integration time, which is more or less the same as a fixed exposure time in photography. In contrast the TSL2561-library uses various integration times and maybe this is possible on the APDS9960 too. To eventually achieve this in the future, the option to set this integration time at runtime was added. Every argument between 3 and 255 sets the ATIME-register. The formula is: integration time = (256-ATIME) 2,78 ms, so with the default value of 219 we get (256-219) 2,78 = 102,86 ms. That means a smaller ATIME makes the integration time longer and more photons are captured, which might be usable for (very) low light conditions, because otherwise the sensor will saturate too early. The opposite is valid for a bigger ATIME value. The change of this value only makes sense for: users who need to change the sensitivity, if the sensor resides behind dark glass or want to contribute to the development of a new LUX-calculation in the driver. If we get enough feedback, this could lead to an improvement on the software side. Feel free to open (or search for) an issue, if you have measured the APDS9960 against other devices with different ATIME-values at different light levels. This is not a trivial task though.","title":"Known Issues"},{"location":"APDS-9960/#breakout-boards","text":"","title":"Breakout Boards"},{"location":"API/","text":"Basic API information ~ Tasmota can easily be extended by developers using provided function pointers as callback Ids.

Currently you can only use the local Philips Hue/Wemo emulation - limited to lights and switches. You can imagine for instance controlling your Sonoff RF Bridge and send IR codes to your TV. Alexa skills need to communicate back to your devices, which is easy using MQTT and AWS IoT 2. No need for a local gateway Of course you can do it with a local gateway like Raspberry PI using many of the open-source solutions (Domoticz...). You can also do it entirely from the cloud without the hassle of managing and updating a local gateway. On top of it, AWS IoT provides tools to collect and archive your data, automate (AWS IoT things). Maximum security Keep in mind that AWS IoT is based with 'security first' in mind. All the data in AWS IoT is your data and is not shared with anyone else. Communication is done over TLS 1.2 tunnels, using client certificates to authenticate each device. Up to now it was challenging to enable TLS on ESP8266 because of the high memory requirements of TLS. Thanks to the switch of Arduino to BearSSL and aggressive optimization, the amount of memory needed is as low as 6.0k during normal operation, and an additional 6.6k during connection (TLS handshake). This makes it totally doable with standard 'Tasmota' firmware with Web and Hue emulation activated. You should see more than 20k of memory still available. Caveats ~ AWS IoT requires each Tasmota device to have its own distinct Private Key and Certificate (~800 bytes). Although you could imagine to use the same Private Key in all your devices, this is considered as a very bad practice. You are warned! During TLS handshake, a secondary stack of 5.3k is allocated on the heap to allow BearSSL to have enough stack room. Memory is freed at the end of the handshake. Allocating such big chunks of memory can cause issues when heap fragmentation gets too high. If you see memory going below 15KB, you may experience crashes. Cost AWS provides a Free Tier that allows you to use some services for free up to a specific level. For example, it allows you to have 50 devices connecting 24 hours a day exchanging 300 messages per day. For a typical house, there is a good chance the service costs you nothing (the first year). How to configure? ~ AWS IoT requires a distinct Private Key and Certificate per Tasmota device. Currently you need to custom compile your Tasmota firmware and burn the Key and Certificate in your firmware. We will later explore how to configure them separately. Here is a simple guide. 0. Open an AWS Account ~ If you don't have already one, just follow the guide: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/ 1. Prerequisites ~ You will need to install/compile the following: Complete environment to compile Tasmota, ex: PlatformIO (PlatformIO) Recent version of openssl 2. Enable AWS IoT in Tasmota ~ Using your favorite IDE, create user_config_override.h and add the required compilation directives as documented at the top of this article. Note: TLS handshake takes ~1.2s on ESP8266 @80MHz. You may choose to switch to 160MHz if the power supply of your device supports it. If you do so, handshake time should be ~0.7s. Compile the firmware and ensure it completes successfully. This step is only to check compilation goes well. Your firmware is still not usable since it does not contain the Private Key + Certificate. 3. Flash your device ~ Flash your device the normal way; either through serial or OTA. If you use OTA, first flash a sonoff-minimal firmware, then your target firmware. 4. Configure AWS IoT Policy (to be done once) ~ Open the AWS Console and select the target region. In the example below we will use (EU) Frankfurt (eu-central-1). Download the CloudFormation template Tasmota-MqttPolicy and use it in AWS CloudFormation. Or click on the link for the region you have chosen: Region Code Launch US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1 EU (Frankfurt) eu-central-1 EU (Paris) eu-west-3 At the Create Stack screen, click Next . At the Specify stack details screen, keep all default parameters and click Next . At the Configure stack options screen, keep all default parameters and click Next . At the Review TasmotaMqttPolicy screen, scroll down and click Create Stack . The stack usually takes less than 2 minutes to complete. Wait for it to reach CREATE_COMPLETE state. If you have left the parameter RetentionPolicy to Retain , then you can delete this CloudFormation stack (it will not delete the Policy). Click on the Delete button. After less than 2 minutes, the stack should have reached the state DELETE_COMPLETE 5. Create an AWS IoT Thing with Private Key and Certificate (once per Tasmota device) ~ The provided AWS CloudFormation template will create the required resources to create: One AWS IoT Thing One Private key One Certificate signed by AWS IoT Temporary resources (AWS Lambda functions, AWS IAM resources) that you can delete once the Tasmota thing is created. Open the AWS Console and select the target region. In the example below we will use (EU) Frankfurt (eu-central-1). Download the CloudFormation template Tasmota-Thing and use it in AWS CloudFormation. Or click on the link for the region you have chosen: Region Code Launch US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1 EU (Frankfurt) eu-central-1 EU (Paris) eu-west-3 At the Create Stack screen, click Next . At the Specify stack details screen, keep all default parameters and click Next . Note: you can change the name of the Thing in AWS IoT by specifying the parameter ThingParamName. At the Configure stack options screen, keep all default parameters and click Next . At the Review Tasmota-91 screen, scroll down, check the box I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources. and click Create Stack . The stack usually takes less than 4 minutes to complete. Wait for it to reach CREATE_COMPLETE state. You need to copy & paste the contents of the Outputs tab of the CloudFormation stack: MqttHost , TlsKey1 , TlsKey2 Keep a copy of those parameters in a file, you might need them again. Cleaning : to avoid having CloudFormation templates piling up in your console, you can delete them. The created resources will remain, if you have left the parameter RetentionPolicy to Retain . 6. Configure Tasmota device ~ This is the last step, you need to configure the MQTT parameters. The easiest way is through the web console. We will only cut and paste parameters from the Outputs tab of the CloudFormation console. Configure the AWS EndPoint Copy and paste in the web console the content of MqttHost Example: Backlog MqttHost <your_endpoint>-ats.iot.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com; MqttPort 8883 This will trigger a reboot of the device. Optional, change the topic to distinguish the devices from each others: Topic sonoff/Tasmota-01 Check that the key store is empty Type the following command: TLSKey hh : mm : ss CMD : TLSKey hh : mm : ss MQT : stat/<topic>/ RESULT = { \"TLSKey1\" :- 1 , \"TLSKey2\" :- 1 } If both values are -1 , it means it does not contain any key. If you need to reset the key store, use the command TLSKey 0 . Configure the Private Key and Certificate AWS IoT credentials are composed of two distinct parts, first a Private Key - this is the secret that will allow your device to prove it is who it pretends to be. Consider this as sensitive as a password. The Private Key is exactly 32 bytes (256 bits). The second part is the Certificate delivered by AWS IoT. Tasmota will also need it to authenticate to the AWS IoT endpoint. Both credentials must be stored in Tasmota Flash memory, in that order, using the new TLSKey command. TlsKey1 stores the Private Key. TlsKey2 stores the Certificate. There is no command to retrieve the private key from a Tasmota device, but keep in mind this secret information can easily be dumped via Serial if somebody gets physical access to the device (ESP8266 does not contain any secure storage area). Simply Copy and Paste the two commands from TlsKey1 and TlsKey2 . TLSKey1 <secret_key_secret_key_secret_key>= TLSKey2 MIIC<certificate_very_long_string>= TLSKey1 and TLSKey2 must be entered in that order. If successful, you should see a message similar to: hh : mm : ss MQT : stat /<topic>/ RESULT = { \"TLSKey1\" : 32 , \"TLSKey2\" : 641 } You need to check that both values are not \"-1\". The value for \"TLSKey1\" should always be 32. The value for \"TLSKey2\" varies depending on several parameters, and should be within the 640-700 bytes range. Connect to AWS IoT Once the TLSKey1 and TLSKey2 are entered, Tasmota will try to connect to AWS IoT. Keep in mind that AWS IoT does not support 'retained' messages. Whatever the 'retained' configuration in Tasmota, messages are always published as 'retained=false'. Here is an example of output you should see: 00 : 00 : 04 HTP : Web server active on sonoff - 4585 with IP address 192.168 . 1.59 00 : 00 : 04 UPP : Multicast ( re ) joined 21 : 28 : 25 MQT : Attempting connection ... 21 : 28 : 25 MQT : AWS IoT endpoint : xxxxxxxxxxxxx - ats . iot . eu - central - 1 . amazonaws . com 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : AWS IoT connected in 1279 ms 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : Connected 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : tele /tasmota/ LWT = Online 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : cmnd /tasmota/ POWER = 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : tele /tasmota/ INFO1 = { \"Module\" : \"Sonoff Basic\" , \"Version\" : \"6.5.0.14(sonoff)\" , \"FallbackTopic\" : \"cmnd/DVES_67B1E9_fb/\" , \"GroupTopic\" : \"sonoffs\" } 7. Check end-to-end communication ~ In the AWS IoT console, click on \" Test \" in the left panel. In the \" Subscription topic \" field, type +/sonoff/# then click on \" Subscribe to topic \". This will display all MQTT messages received. Type a command in the Web Tasmota console, you should see MQTT message flow. Enjoy! 8. Cleaning ~ Cleaning : to avoid having CloudFormation templates piling up in your console, you can delete them. The created resources will remain, if you have left the parameter RetentionPolicy to Retain . 9. Troubleshooting ~ TLSError shows any error at the TLS level. See here for most common error codes. For implementation details, see here ~ Appendix: Manual configuration ~ 1. Prerequisites ~ You will need to install/compile the following: Complete environment to compile Tasmota, ex: PlatformIO (PlatformIO) Recent version of openssl 2. Configure AWS IoT (to be done once) ~ Open the AWS Console. Click on \" Services \" and select \" IoT Core \". Select the AWS Region where you want to locate your data, for ex: \" (EU) Frankfurt \". Now we need to create a security policy to allow your Tasmota devices to connect to AWS IoT, publish and subscribe to topics. On the left panel, click on \" Secure \" > \" Policies \". Click on the \" Create \" button in the upper right corner. Enter in the \" Name \" field, enter the name of your policy, for ex: \" TasmotaMqttPolicy \". Then click on \" Advanced mode \" Cut and paste the policy below. Click on \" Create \" in the lower right corner. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"iot:Connect\", \"iot:Publish\", \"iot:Subscribe\", \"iot:Receive\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } 3. Create a Private Key and Certificate (once per Tasmota device) ~ Do not use the default AWS IoT feature to generate your private key online. It creates a 2048 bits RSA key. Instead we are using elliptic curves keys - they are much smaller in memory than RSA keys (this saves ~1k of memory) and the handshake is significantly faster. First create an ECC private key for your device (as described in this Blog ). Keep you private key in a safe place. $ openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out tasmota-01.key Next, using this private key, create a certificate signing request (CSR). When asked enter the certificate details. This is not really used later, you can just enter a 2 letters country code like \" EU \" and leave all other fields blank (type 8 times enter). $ openssl req -new -sha256 -key tasmota-01.key -nodes -out tasmota-01.csr You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request. What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN. There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.' , the field will be left blank. ----- Country Name ( 2 letter code ) [] :EU <enter> State or Province Name ( full name ) [] : <enter> Locality Name ( eg, city ) [] : <enter> Organization Name ( eg, company ) [] : <enter> Organizational Unit Name ( eg, section ) [] : <enter> Common Name ( eg, fully qualified host name ) [] : <enter> Email Address [] : <enter> Please enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request A challenge password [] : <enter> Next ask AWS IoT to sign your key with its certificate. On the left panel, click on \" Secure \" > \" Certificates \". Click on \" Create a certificate \". Then choose the \" Create with CSR \" button, locate your CSR file from above. Click on \" Upload file \". Download the certificate file, click on \" Download \", save the file as \" tasmota-01.cert.pem \". Important : don't forget to click on the \" Activate \" to activate the certificate. Your Private Key and Certificates are ready to use. Now we need to register the Tasmota Device. 4. Write down your AWS IoT endpoint (same for all devices) ~ Click on \" Settings \" in the left panel. You should see a field called \" Custom endpoint \". Write down the endpoint domain name. It should look like this (if you have chosen the Frankfurt region: <xxxxxxxxxxxxxx>-ats.iot.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com This is your MQTT endpoint, the port is 8883 - MQTT over TLS. 5. Register the device in AWS IoT (once per Tasmota device) ~ Now on the left pane, click on \" Manage \" > \" Things \". Click on \" Register a thing \", then \" Create a single thing \". Give your device a name like \" Tasmota-01 \". Scroll down and click \" Next \" at the botton right. Then click on \" Create thing without a certificate \". Now we need to associate the certificate created earlier to your device. In the left panel, click back on \" Secure \" > \" Certificates \". Select the certificate created earlier. In the next pane, click on \" Actions \" in the upper right part. First select \" Attach policy \", check \" TasmotaMqttPolicy \" and \" Attach \". Click again on \" Actions \" and select \" Attach thing \", check \" Tasmota-01 \" and \" Attach \". Your setup is done in AWS IoT. Let's proceed to the custom firmware. 8. Prepare your AWS IoT credentials ~ You will now need to convert your AWS IoT credentials to Tasmota commands. Credentials are composed of two distinct parts, first a Private Key - this is the secret that will allow your device to prove it is who it pretends to be. Consider this as sensitive as a password. The Private Key is exactly 32 bytes (256 bits). The second part is the Certificate delivered by AWS IoT. Tasmota will also need it to authenticate to the AWS IoT endpoint. Both credentials must be stored in Tasmota Flash memory, in that order, using the new TLSKey command. a. First check that the key store is empty Type the following command: TLSKey hh : mm : ss CMD : TLSKey hh : mm : ss MQT : stat / tasmota / RESULT = { \"TLSKey1\" :- 1 , \"TLSKey2\" :- 1 } If both values are -1 , it means it does not contain any key. If you need to reset the key store, use the command TLSKey 0 . b. Convert the Private Key We will extract the 32 bytes Private key from tasmota-01.key generated above. 1-line method, use the following command: (fake key below) openssl ec -in tasmota-01.key -inform PEM -outform DER | openssl asn1parse -inform DER | head -3 | tail -1 | awk -F':' '{ print $4 }' | xxd -r -p | base64 | echo \"TLSKey1 $(</dev/stdin)\" Example: openssl ec -in tasmota-01.key -inform PEM -outform DER | openssl asn1parse -inform DER | head -3 | tail -1 | awk -F':' '{ print $4 }' | xxd -r -p | base64 | echo \"TLSKey1 $(</dev/stdin)\" read EC key writing EC key TLSKey1 UvBgyCuPr/lKSgwumf/8o/mIsKQPBHn3ZZAGZl4ui9E= Cut and paste the command starting with TLSKey1 ... into the Tasmota Web Console or through MQTT. hh : mm : ss CMD : TLSKey1 UvBgyCuPr / lKSgwumf / 8 o / mIsKQPBHn3ZZAGZl4ui9E = hh : mm : ss MQT : stat / tasmota / RESULT = { \"TLSKey1\" : 32 , \"TLSKey2\" :- 1 } Alternative method: Convert the Private Key file from PEM to DER (binary format): openssl ec -in tasmota-01.key -inform PEM -outform DER -out tasmota-01.key.der Dump the ASN.1 format from the DER file: openssl asn1parse - inform DER - in tasmota -01. key . der 0 : d = 0 hl = 2 l = 119 cons : SEQUENCE 2 : d = 1 hl = 2 l = 1 prim : INTEGER : 01 5 : d = 1 hl = 2 l = 32 prim : OCTET STRING [ HEX DUMP ] : 52F 060 C82B8FAFF94A4A0C2E99FFFCA3F988B0A40F0479F7659006665E2E8BD1 39 : d = 1 hl = 2 l = 10 cons : cont [ 0 ] 41 : d = 2 hl = 2 l = 8 prim : OBJECT : prime256v1 51 : d = 1 hl = 2 l = 68 cons : cont [ 1 ] 53 : d = 2 hl = 2 l = 66 prim : BIT STRING Then convert the byte stream after [HEX DUMP] to base64 and use it with the TLSKey1 command. c. Convert the Certificate Similarly you will need to convert the file \" tasmota-01.cert.pem \" generated above to a Tasmota command. 1-line version, use the following command: openssl x509 -in tasmota-01.cert.pem -inform PEM -outform DER | base64 | echo \"TLSKey2 $(</dev/stdin)\" Example: (fake certificate) openssl x509 -in tasmota-01.cert.pem -inform PEM -outform DER | base64 | echo \"TLSKey2 $(</dev/stdin)\" TLSKey2 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 Copy and paste the last line starting with TLSKey2 ... into the Web Tasmota Console or through MQTT.

Prepare your AWS IoT credentials"},{"location":"AWS-IoT/","text":"Tip New simplified configuration, since AWS IoT doesn't require private certificates anymore and can use password authentication. Requires v8.5.0.1 or higher. The certificate based authentication is kept for reference. New simplified and automated configuration We now provide easy to use AWS CloudFormation templates to generate the private key and sign the certificate. The manual method is now in Appendix This feature is not included in precompiled binaries To use it you must compile your build . Add the following to user_config_override.h : #ifndef USE_MQTT_TLS #define USE_MQTT_TLS #define USE_MQTT_TLS_CA_CERT // Optional but highly recommended #endif #ifndef USE_MQTT_AWS_IOT_LIGHT #define USE_MQTT_AWS_IOT_LIGHT #endif #ifdef USE_DISCOVERY #undef USE_DISCOVERY #endif As of Tasmota version 8.5.0.1, device-specific private key and certificate are no more required. We introduces AWS_IOT_LIGHT to use password based authentication. Legacy private certificate authentication can be found here . Benefits ~ AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices such as sensors, actuators, embedded micro-controllers. This basically allows to communicate in both direction from the cloud using MQTT over secure channels using TLS. 1. More Alexa controls It's actually easy to develop smarthome Alexa skills, so that you can control your whole house. Currently you can only use the local Philips Hue/Wemo emulation - limited to lights and switches. You can imagine for instance controlling your Sonoff RF Bridge and send IR codes to your TV. Alexa skills need to communicate back to your devices, which is easy using MQTT and AWS IoT 2. No need for a local gateway Of course you can do it with a local gateway like Raspberry PI using many of the open-source solutions (Domoticz...). You can also do it entirely from the cloud without the hassle of managing and updating a local gateway. On top of it, AWS IoT provides tools to collect and archive your data, automate (AWS IoT things). Maximum security Keep in mind that AWS IoT is based with 'security first' in mind. All the data in AWS IoT is your data and is not shared with anyone else. Communication is done over TLS 1.2 tunnels. Thanks to the switch of Arduino to BearSSL and aggressive optimization, the amount of memory needed is as low as 6.0k during normal operation, and an additional 6.6k during connection (TLS handshake). This makes it totally doable with standard 'Tasmota' firmware with Web and Hue emulation activated. You should see more than 20k of memory still available. Caveats ~ During TLS handshake, a secondary stack of 4.8k is allocated on the heap to allow BearSSL to have enough stack room. Memory is freed at the end of the handshake. Allocating such big chunks of memory can cause issues when heap fragmentation gets too high. If you see memory going below 15KB, you may experience crashes. Cost AWS provides a Free Tier that allows you to use some services for free up to a specific level. For example, it allows you to have 50 devices connecting 24 hours a day exchanging 300 messages per day. For a typical house, there is a good chance the service costs you nothing (the first year). How to configure? ~ AWS IoT now works with Password authentication. Although it is not a good practice to use the same password for all your devices, it is technically working and the easiest way to start with Tasmota and AWS IoT. Here is a simple guide. 0. Open an AWS Account ~ If you don't have already one, just follow the guide: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/ 1. Prerequisites ~ You will need to install/compile the following: Complete environment to compile Tasmota, ex: PlatformIO (PlatformIO) 2. Enable AWS IoT in Tasmota ~ Using your favorite IDE, create user_config_override.h and add the required compilation directives as documented at the top of this article. Note: TLS handshake takes ~1.2s on ESP8266 @80MHz. You may choose to switch to 160MHz if the power supply of your device supports it. If you do so, handshake time should be ~0.7s. Compile the firmware and ensure it completes successfully. This step is only to check compilation goes well. Your firmware is still not usable since it does not contain the Private Key + Certificate. 3. Flash your device ~ Flash your device the normal way; either through serial or OTA. If you use OTA, first flash a sonoff-minimal firmware, then your target firmware. 4. Configure AWS IoT Policy (to be done once) ~ Open the AWS Console and select the target region. In the example below we will use (EU) Frankfurt (eu-central-1). Download the CloudFormation template TasmotaAuth and use it in AWS CloudFormation. Or click on the link for the region you have chosen: Region Code Launch US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1 EU (Frankfurt) eu-central-1 EU (Paris) eu-west-3 At the Create Stack screen, click Next . At the Specify stack details screen, keep all default parameters and click Next . At the Configure stack options screen, keep all default parameters and click Next . At the Review TasmotaMqttPolicy screen, scroll down and click Create Stack . The stack usually takes less than 1 minute to complete. Wait for it to reach CREATE_COMPLETE state. Copy the commands under BackLogCommand , you will need it to configure Tasmota devices. If you have left the parameter RetentionPolicy to Retain , then you can delete this CloudFormation stack (it will not delete the Policy). Click on the Delete button. After less than 2 minutes, the stack should have reached the state DELETE_COMPLETE 6. Configure Tasmota device ~ This is the last step, you need to configure the MQTT parameters. The easiest way is through the web console. We will only cut and paste parameters from the Outputs tab of the CloudFormation console. Example: BackLog SetOption3 1 ; SetOption103 1 ; MqttHost a ........... . u-ats . iot . eu-central-1 . amazonaws . com ; MqttPort 443 ; MqttUser tasmota ? x-amz-customauthorizer-name = TasmotaAuth ; MqttPassword YknLuSd2tBY2HodwI / 7RqA == 11 : 28 : 44 CMD : BackLog SetOption3 1 ; SetOption103 1 ; MqttHost a ........... . u-ats . iot . eu-central-1 . amazonaws . com ; MqttPort 443 ; MqttUser tasmota ? x-amz-customauthorizer-name = TasmotaAuth ; MqttPassword YknLuSd2tBY2HodwI / 7RqA == 11 : 28 : 44 MQT : stat / tasmota_4B3316 / RESULT = { \"SetOption3\":\"ON\" } 11 : 28 : 44 MQT : stat / tasmota_4B3316 / RESULT = { \"SetOption103\":\"ON\" } 11 : 28 : 45 MQT : stat / tasmota_4B3316 / RESULT = { \"MqttHost\":\"a...........u-ats.iot.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\" } 11 : 28 : 45 MQT : stat / tasmota_4B3316 / RESULT = { \"MqttPort\":443 } 11 : 28 : 45 MQT : stat / tasmota_4B3316 / RESULT = { \"MqttUser\":\"tasmota?x-amz-customauthorizer-name=TasmotaAuth\" } 11 : 28 : 45 MQT : stat / tasmota_4B3316 / RESULT = { \"MqttPassword\":\"YknLuSd2tBY2HodwI/7RqA==\" } 11 : 28 : 47 APP : Restarting Connect to AWS IoT Once the MQTTHost and MQTTPort are configured, Tasmota will try to connect to AWS IoT. Keep in mind that AWS IoT does not support 'retained' messages. Whatever the 'retained' configuration in Tasmota, messages are always published as 'retained=false'. Here is an example of output you should see: 00 : 00 : 04 HTP : Web server active on sonoff - 4585 with IP address 192.168 . 1.59 00 : 00 : 04 UPP : Multicast ( re ) joined 21 : 28 : 25 MQT : Attempting connection ... 21 : 28 : 25 MQT : AWS IoT endpoint : xxxxxxxxxxxxx - ats . iot . eu - central - 1 . amazonaws . com 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : AWS IoT connected in 1279 ms 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : Connected 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : tele /tasmota/ LWT = Online 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : cmnd /tasmota/ POWER = 21 : 28 : 26 MQT : tele /tasmota/ INFO1 = { \"Module\" : \"Sonoff Basic\" , \"Version\" : \"9.0.0.2(sonoff)\" , \"FallbackTopic\" : \"cmnd/DVES_67B1E9_fb/\" , \"GroupTopic\" : \"sonoffs\" } 7. Check end-to-end communication ~ In the AWS IoT console, click on \" Test \" in the left panel. In the \" Subscription topic \" field, type +/sonoff/# then click on \" Subscribe to topic \". This will display all MQTT messages received. Type a command in the Web Tasmota console, you should see MQTT message flow. Enjoy! 8. Cleaning ~ Cleaning : to avoid having CloudFormation templates piling up in your console, you can delete them. The created resources will remain, if you have left the parameter RetentionPolicy to Retain . 9. Troubleshooting ~ TLSError shows any error at the TLS level. See here for most common error codes.

Shutter Modes ~ There are five shutter modes which defines how the relays operate. Additional you can define on any relay PulseTime to change the relay into a pulse relay whre the pulse changes start/stop. Additionaly we recomment at least for mode=1 to define an Interlock settings. The examples below are for a ShutterRelay1 1 configuration (using Relay1 and Relay2). Shutter mode 1 - Normal Operation First relay: OFF/DOWN, Second relay: OFF/UP - Interlock 1,2 (Interlocked relay pair) - Interlock ON Shutter mode 2 - Circuit Safe First relay: ON/OFF, Second relay: UP/DOWN - Interlock OFF Shutter mode 3 - Garage Motors First relay: OFF/DOWN PULSE, Second relay: OFF/UP PULSE Shutter mode 4 - Stepper Motors First relay: ON/OFF, Second relay: UP/DOWN PWM: Stepper signal, COUNTER: Stepper position signal - PWM and COUNTER defined Shutter mode 5 - Servo Motors (PWM position based servo) First relay: ON/OFF, Second relay: UP/DOWN (optional not used) PWM: Stepper signal PWMfrequency 200 ( This is mandatory for most relay to get correct PWM duty cylces) SetOption15 0 (required to store value and make it reboot save) Wiring diagrams for Normal, Stepper motor, and Short Circuit-Safe configurations are available at the end of this page.

In momentary mode (i.e., stepper motor), the relays start or stop the motor. The driver takes care of the direction and proper update of the shutter position. The shutter reports its position and can also be sent to a dedicated position. ShutterPosition = 0 means the shutter is closed and ShutterPosition = 100 means the shutter is open. If you need the position values reversed ( 0 = open, 100 = closed), define and calibrate your shutter as documented below . Then tell Tasmota to reverse the shutter position meaning via the ShutterInvert<x> 1 command. All internal calculations are the same (the log output is the same). Only the interaction with the user and other systems changes. Now ShutterPosition<x> 0 will open the shutter and ShutterPosition<x> 100 will close the shutter. By default, only Shutter1 is enabled when SetOption80 1 is invoked. A maximum of four shutters per device are supported. To enable additional shutters, ShutterRelay<x> <value> must be executed for each additional shutter. Additional shutter declarations must be sequentially numbered, and without gaps (i.e., second shutter is 2, then shutter 3, and finally shutter 4). Disabling a shutter in the middle of the defined set of shutters will disable all other higher numbered shutters. If the disabled shutter is restored, the higher numbered shutters previously declared will also be restored. When a shutter is added or removed, a list of the active shutters, with their parameters, is output to the log. If you intend to remove shutters, explicitly remove each one beginning with the highest numbered shutter. With four shutters, eight Relay<x> components are needed. If manual operation switches ( Switch<x> or Button<x> pairs) are also used, additional input GPIO are required. The ESP82xx device may not have enough free GPIO to support all the shutter connections required. A GPIO expander such as a PCF8574 or MCP230xx can be used. Using manual operation Switch<x> pairs may require setting SwitchMode<x> 4 (inverse follow) for proper switch behavior. Any shutter positioning can be locked ShutterLock<x> 1 . Once executed an ongoing movement is finished while further positioning commands like ShutterOpen<x> , ShutterClose<x> , ShutterStop<x> , ShutterPosition<x> , ... as well as web UI buttons, web UI sliders, and shutter buttons are disabled. This can be used to lock an outdoor blind in case of high wind or rain. You may also disable shutter positioning games by your children. Shutter positioning can be unlocked using ShutterLock<x> 0 . Please be aware that the shutter can still be moved by direct relay control (i.e., power<x> ), or physical switches and buttons. Use hte ShutterButton<x> command prior to ShutterLock to be able to lock buttons. Pulse Motor Support ~ There are shutters that have two relays but only need a pulse to start or stop. Depending on the current situation a pulse will stop the shutter or send it into a specific direction. To use these kinds of shutters a PulseTime must be defined on each relay. The minimum setting that seems to make it work consistently is 2 . A setting of 1 does not work. If the shutter moves too fast and does not react to a stop command, increase the setting to 3 or 4 . Stepper Motor Support ~ Stepper motors can also be used to operate shutters and blinds. Additionally you can operate sliding doors with this configuration. Servo Motor Support ~ Servos are small devices with typical 180\u00b0 or 360\" rotation movement. The position will be drived by the PWM duty cycle time. This will all automatically calculated Smooth RAMP-UP and RAMP-DOWN Support ~ Servos and Steppers also have a velocity control. With ShutterMotorDelay<x> 1.5 you can define a 1.5second soft start/stop before the device reaches it final moving speed. Usefull for moving heavy items like doors. Calibration ~ Shutter calibration video tutorial Set the ShutterOpenDuration<x> to the time the shutter needs to open completely. Set the ShutterCloseDuration<x> at least to the time the shutter needs to close completely. If the shutter does not close completely or runs too long, the calibration point of a closed shutter can be defined with ShutterSetClose<x> . Move the shutter to the close position and execute ShutterSetClose<x> command. ShutterPosition<x> will be reset to 0 ( ShutterClose<x> ). Set the 50% open position of the shutter. Some shutters need some time from totally closed until they begin moving the bottom-most part and opening. This often results a shutter that is less than 50% open when the shutter has been operating for 50% of the set duration. This can be corrected by using ShutterSetHalfway<x> . Use this procedure to calibrate the half-open position: ShutterClose<x> (confirm that the shutter is completely closed) ShutterSetHalfway<x> 50 (reset to default) Move the shutter to actual 50% open position. Use ShutterPosition<x> to inquire the shutter's current position and record the value. This value is a percentage of the total opening (e.g., 63 = 63% of opening). ShutterClose<x> ShutterSetHalfway<x> 63 (using the value from step #4 above) Restart 1 After calibration you might want to enable an additional 1s motor movement by ShutterEnableEndStopTime<x> 1 when the shutter is asked to move to its end positions (0% and 100%). By this you can guarantee that end positions are still reached in case of inaccuracies. Take care to disable this by ShutterEnableEndStopTime<x> 0 before further open or close duration measurements. Increasing Calibration Granularity If you desire that the %-opening closely match what ShutterPosition<x> and web UI indicate, there is a granular calibration matrix available. Ensure that ShutterClose<x> and ShutterOpen<x> moves the shutter more or less to the limit positions and follow this procedure: ShutterSetHalfway<x> 50 (reset to default) ShutterCalibration<x> 30 50 70 90 100 Restart 1 ShutterClose<x> Move the shutter to each of the following opening percentages and measure the shutter's position for each. ShutterPosition<x> 30 (e.g., measurement = 15 ) ShutterPosition<x> 50 (e.g., measurement = 50 ) ShutterPosition<x> 70 (e.g., measurement = 100 ) ShutterPosition<x> 90 (e.g., measurement = 150 ) ShutterPosition<x> 100 (e.g., measurement = 180 ) Finally, enter the position measurements as the calibration values: ShutterCalibration<x> 15 50 100 150 180 ShutterCalibration<x> takes position measurements ( not the time it takes to move). During calibration you position the shutter to an indicated percentage (e.g., 30% ) of opening and measure the shutter position (e.g., 15 ). Use the same unit of measure for all your measurements (e.g., centimeters, inches, steps, etc.). After calibration ShutterPosition<x> 30 will move to 30% opening which will correspond to the position you provided ( 15 ). Notice that there is no calibration for the 10\\% position. On many shutters, there is no movement during the initial phase (i.e., nearly 10% of total time). Therefore the opening could be 0 . This measurement would cause an execution DIV 0 exception. Therefore the first calibration point is 30%. In most cases this is not a large opening so the calibration will be near enough. Yes, until ~10%, the position will be a bit \"off\" but not enough for concern. Motor Movement Delays ~ Some motors need up to one second after power is turned on before they start moving. You can confirm if you are having this issue if opening and closing as a single action works properly but doing this in smaller steps result in a shift of the position. Shutterposition<x> 30 Measure the shutter position. This is the reference_position Shutterposition<x> 80 Measure the shutter position. This is the max_position Shutterposition<x> 30 Return the shutter to starting position. This must be the same position as measured in step #1 ( reference_position ). If not, ShutterCloseDuration must be adjusted. Shutterposition<x> 50 Shutterposition<x> 70 Shutterposition<x> 80 If you do not reach max_position you have a motor delay problem. Measure the shutter position. This is the real_max . Use this value in the calculation below. ShutterMotorDelay<x> <delay> Motor <delay> calculation - fine tune in 0.05 second increments (e.g. 0.65 ) as required. <delay> = ((max_position-real_max) / 2) / (((100/80) * max_position) / ShutterOpenDuration) Close the shutter and repeat this procedure until the motor delay is set properly. Button control ~ When shutter is running in normal ShutterMode: 0 , you already have basic control over the shutter movement using tasmota switches or tasmota buttons in the module configuration to directly drive the shutter relays. For short circuit safe operation ShutterMode: 1 direct control of the relays will not give you a nice user interface since you have to 1st set the direction with one switch or button and 2nd switch on the power by the other switch or button. To have shutter mode independent button control over the shutter and not over its relays one can use the ShutterButton<x> command. It also introduces some more features, see below: ShutterButton<x> <button> <func> <mqtt> This assigns a tasmota button <button> to control your shutter <x> having functionality <func> . The tasmota button <button> must already be configured in the module configuration. You can assign multiple buttons to a single shutter. Any button can only control one shutter (beside the <mqtt> broadcast feature, see description below). Any press of the button while the shutter is moving will immediately stop the shutter. One can remove all button control for shutter <x> by ShutterButton<x> 0 . The assigned button can have one of the following functionalities: Setup for an \"up\" button: ShutterButton<x> <button> up <mqtt> Single press will move shutter to 100%, double press to 50% and tripple press to 74%. Holding the button for more than the hold time (SetOption32) moves all shutters with same <grouptopic> to 100% when <mqtt> is equal to 1 . When <mqtt> is equal to 0 hold action of this button is same as single press. Setup for a \"down\" button: ShutterButton<x> <button> down <mqtt> Single press will move shutter to 0%, double press to 50% and tripple press to 24%. Holding the button for more than the hold time (SetOption32) moves all shutters with same <grouptopic> to 0% when <mqtt> is equal to 1 . When <mqtt> is equal to 0 hold action of this button is same as single press. Setup for an \"updown\" button: ShutterButton<x> <button> updown <mqtt> Single press will move shutter to 100%, double press down to 0% and tripple press to 50%. No hold action and no other shutter control by MQTT, <mqtt> is don't care here. Setup for an \"toggle\" button: ShutterButton<x> <button> toggle <mqtt> Single press will toggle shutter, double press will move it to 50%. No hold action and no other shutter control by MQTT, <mqtt> is don't care here. More advanced control of the button press actions is given by the following ShutterButton<x> command syntax: ShutterButton<x> <button> <p1> <p2> <p3> <ph> <m1> <m2> <m3> <mh> <mi> <button> 1..4 : Button number, 0/- : disable buttons for this shutter <p1> 0..100 : single press position, t : toggle, - : disable <p2> 0..100 : double press position, t : toggle, - : disable <p3> 0..100 : tripple press position, t : toggle, - : disable <ph> 0..100 : hold press position, t : toggle, - : disable <m1> 1 : enable single press position MQTT broadcast, 0/- : disable <m2> 1 : enable double press position MQTT broadcast, 0/- : disable <m3> 1 : enable tripple press position MQTT broadcast, 0/- : disable <mh> 1 : enable hold press position MQTT broadcast, 0/- : disable <mi> 1 : enable MQTT broadcast to all shutter indices, 0/- : disable Parameters are optional. When missing, all subsequent parameters are set to disable . By a button single press the shutter is set to position <p1> . Double press will drive the shutter to position <p2> and tripple press to position <p3> . Holding the button for more than the SetOption32 time sets the shutter position to <ph> . Any button action <p1> to <ph> can be disabled by setting the parameter to - . Independent from configuration <p1> to <ph> any press of the button while the shutter is moving will immediately stop the shutter. Global steering of all your shutters at home is supported by additional MQTT broadcast. By any button action a corresponding MQTT command can be initiated to the <grouptopic> of the device. For single press this can be enabled by <m1> equal to 1 , disabling is indicated by - . Double to hold MQTT configurations are given by <m2> to <mh> , correspondingly. When <mi> is equal to - only cmnd/<grouptopic>/Shutterposition<x> <p1..h> is fired. When <mi> is equal to 1 , <x> = 1..4 is used to control any shutter number of a tasmota device having same <grouptopic> . Example ShutterButton<x> <button> 100 50 74 100 0 0 0 1 1 is same as ShutterButton<x> <button> up 1 . ShutterButton<x> <button> 0 50 24 0 0 0 0 1 1 is same as ShutterButton<x> <button> down 1 . ShutterButton<x> <button> 100 0 50 - 0 0 0 0 0 is same as ShutterButton<x> <button> updown 0 . ShutterButton<x> <button> t 50 - - 0 0 0 0 0 is same as ShutterButton<x> <button> toggle 0 . Module WiFi setup, restart, upgrade and reset according to Buttons and Switches are supported \"child and fool save\" only when no button restriction (SetOption1) is given and when all configured shutter buttons of that shutter are pressed 5x, 6x, 7x times or hold long simultaneously. Button remote control ~ One can use any other tasmota module with attached button(s) or switch(es) to remote control a shutter using rules. Similar behavior as direct button control can be achieved by applying ShutterStopClose, ShutterStopOpen, ShutterStopToggle, ShutterStopPosition commands.

The configuration is very similar to the Circuit Safe (Shuttermode 1) configuration. To operate a stepper motor requires driver module such as the A4988 and uses EN (enable), DIR (direction), STP (Stepper) for controls. If everything is defined correctly the shuttermode 3 will be reported at boot time. Tasmota supports a maximum of four shutters with one stepper motor per shutter simultanously. In very rare conditions where two or more shutters simoultanously move the last mm it can happen than one shutter moves to far. Stepper drivers configuration tutorials: A4988 DRV8825 TMC2208 Modifying a 28BYJ-48 12V stepper motor from unipolar to bipolar tutorial Bill of Materials Example configuration EN and DIR are on Relay1i and Relay2 respectively. Please be aware to use the inverse relay for the enable signal. The STP signal is assigned as a PWM<x> component where <x> matches the number of the shutter (e.g., PWM1 for Shutter1 ). The shutter feature adjusts the PWM frequency to operate the motor for proper shutter operation. The stepper motor frequency setting is a global setting all PWM components on the device. This means that all shutters on the device will operate at the same speed. Therefore no PWM devices other than shutters can be connected to the same Tasmota device. The frequency of the PWM can be changed from 1000Hz to any value up to 10,000Hz. The command ShutterFrequency globally changes this. Be aware that most 12V operated motors cannot work faster than 2,000Hz. 5,000Hz.10,000Hz is possible by increasing the supplied voltage to 24V and use ShutterMotorDelay to allow a slow speed up/speed down. The maximum voltage of the A4988 is 36V. The TMC2208 is much more silent than the others but also significant slower and does not like high frequencies. For example, the speed at 24V is half o A4988 Finally a GPIO must be assigned as Counter1 . This counter is used to keep track of the steps and send the stepper to the correct position. The Counter1 GPIO must be connected to the PWM1 GPIO. Otherwise the stepper and your shutter will run continually or freeze up randomly. Only bipolar stepper motors may be used (see above). You must properly configure the stepper motor driver (see above). ShutterOpenDuration and ShutterCloseDuration can be different. Shutter with Stepper motors always match positions exact. There is no need to vary ShutterOpenDuration and ShutterCloseDuration . Anyhow, if you decrease ShutterCloseDuration the Shutter will close with a higher speed on a virtual higher ShutterFrequency if possible. Same vice versa. You can define a soft start/stop by defining a ShutterMotorDelay . This causes the driver to ramp the speed up and down during the defined duration. The change of the ShutterMotorDelay does NOT change the distance the shutter makes. This is very convinent to trim the accelerate and decelerate rate without changeing the distance.

Rules Tasmota rule triggers: Shutter<x>#Position is triggered at start, during and at the end of movement reporting actual position ( %value% =0-100) Shutter<x>#Direction is triggered at start, during and at the end of movement reporting actual direction ( %value% : -1 =close direction, 0 =no movement, 1 =open direction) Shutter<x>#Target is triggered at start, during and at the end of movement reporting current target ( %value% 0-100) Shutter#Moving is triggered during movement and just before moving (shutter independently). If VAR is set to 99 then this trigger will be executed BEFORE the shutter starts. You can start the shutter after rule execution by setting VAR to 0 or wait 10seconds before the timeout kicks in. After the movement with shutter#moved the var must be set back to 99 and the inital rule must be enabled again. The inital rule has to be defined to run ONCE.

In momentary mode (i.e., stepper motor), the relays start or stop the motor. The driver takes care of the direction and proper update of the shutter position. The shutter reports its position and can also be sent to a dedicated position. ShutterPosition = 0 means the shutter is closed and ShutterPosition = 100 means the shutter is open. If you need the position values reversed ( 0 = open, 100 = closed), define and calibrate your shutter as documented below . Then tell Tasmota to reverse the shutter position meaning via the ShutterInvert<x> 1 command. All internal calculations are the same (the log output is the same). Only the interaction with the user and other systems changes. Now ShutterPosition<x> 0 will open the shutter and ShutterPosition<x> 100 will close the shutter. By default, only Shutter1 is enabled when SetOption80 1 is invoked. A maximum of four shutters per device are supported. To enable additional shutters, ShutterRelay<x> <value> must be executed for each additional shutter. Additional shutter declarations must be sequentially numbered, and without gaps (i.e., second shutter is 2, then shutter 3, and finally shutter 4). Disabling a shutter in the middle of the defined set of shutters will disable all other higher numbered shutters. If the disabled shutter is restored, the higher numbered shutters previously declared will also be restored. When a shutter is added or removed, a list of the active shutters, with their parameters, is output to the log. If you intend to remove shutters, explicitly remove each one beginning with the highest numbered shutter. With four shutters, eight Relay<x> components are needed. If manual operation switches ( Switch<x> or Button<x> pairs) are also used, additional input GPIO are required. The ESP82xx device may not have enough free GPIO to support all the shutter connections required. A GPIO expander such as a PCF8574 or MCP230xx can be used. Using manual operation Switch<x> pairs may require setting SwitchMode<x> 4 (inverse follow) for proper switch behavior. Any shutter positioning can be locked ShutterLock<x> 1 .

Use this procedure to calibrate the half-open position: ShutterClose<x> (confirm that the shutter is completely closed) ShutterSetHalfway<x> 50 (reset to default) Move the shutter to actual 50% open position. Use ShutterPosition<x> to inquire the shutter's current position and record the value. This value is a percentage of the total opening (e.g., 63 = 63% of opening). ShutterClose<x> ShutterSetHalfway<x> 63 (using the value from step #4 above) Restart 1 After calibration you might want to enable an additional 1s motor movement by ShutterEnableEndStopTime<x> 1 when the shutter is asked to move to its end positions (0% and 100%). By this you can guarantee that end positions are still reached in case of inaccuracies. Take care to disable this by ShutterEnableEndStopTime<x> 0 before further open or close duration measurements.","title":"Calibration"},{"location":"Blinds-and-Shutters/#motor-movement-delays","text":"Some motors need up to one second after power is turned on before they start moving.

On the one hand there is support for the use of \"iBeacons\" on some modules of the HM-1x family. The second part consists of 3 drivers that can read the data from BLE sensors from the relatively diverse Xiaomi universe. Presence detection with iBeacons or BLE sensor gateway using HM-1x or nRF24L01(+) peripherals iBeacon ~ This feature is included only in tasmota-sensors.bin Otherwise you must compile your build . Add the following to user_config_override.h : #ifndef USE_IBEACON #define USE_IBEACON // Add support for bluetooth LE passive scan of ibeacon devices #endif Tasmota uses a BLE 4.x module to scan for iBeacon devices. This driver is working with HM-10 and clones and HM16/HM17 Bluetooth modules and potentially with other HM-1x modules depending on firmware capabilities. Features ~ For a list of all available commands see Sensor52 command. This driver reports all beacons found during a scan with its ID (derived from beacon's MAC address) prefixed with IBEACON_ and RSSI value. Every beacon report is published as an MQTT tele/%topic%/SENSOR in a separate message: tele/ibeacon/SENSOR = { \"Time\" : \"2020-03-24T20:09:40\" , \"IBEACON_FF34C21G2174\" :{ \"RSSI\" : -81 }} tele/ibeacon/SENSOR = { \"Time\" : \"2020-03-24T20:09:42\" , \"IBEACON_DEAABC788BC1\" :{ \"RSSI\" : -60 }} If the beacon can no longer be found during a scan and the timeout interval has passed the beacon's RSSI is set to zero (0) and it is no longer displayed in the webUI tele/ibeacon/SENSOR = { \"Time\" : \"2020-03-24T20:05:00\" , \"IBEACON_DEAABC788BC1\" :{ \"RSSI\" : -0 }} Tip When first connected some modules will be in peripheral mode. You have to change it to central mode using commands Sensor52 1 and Sensor52 2 . Supported Devices ~ All Apple compatible iBeacon devices should be discoverable. Various nRF51822 beacons should be fully Apple compatible, programmable and their battery lasts about a year. Amazon.com Aliexpress Cheap \"iTag\" beacons with a beeper. The battery on these lasts only about a month. Aliexpress eBay Amazon.com Tip You can activate a beacon with a beeper using command IBEACON_%BEACONID%_RSSI 99 (ID is visible in webUI and SENSOR reports). This command can freeze the Bluetooth module and beacon scanning will stop. After a reboot of Tasmota the beacon will start beeping and scanning will resume. Tasmota and BLE-sensors ~ Different vendors offer Bluetooth solutions as part of the XIAOMI family often under the MIJIA-brand (while AQUARA is the typical name for a ZigBee sensor). The sensors supported by Tasmota use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to transmit the sensor data, but they differ in their accessibilities quite substantially. Basically all of them use of so-called \u201eMiBeacons\u201c which are BLE advertisement packets with a certain data structure, which are broadcasted by the devices automatically while the device is not in an active bluetooth connection. The frequency of these messages is set by the vendor and ranges from one per 3 seconds to one per hour (for the battery status of the LYWSD03MMC). Motion sensors and BLE remote controls start to send when an event is triggered. These packets already contain the sensor data and can be passively received by other devices and will be published regardless if a user decides to read out the sensors via connections or not. Thus the battery life of a BLE sensor is not influenced by reading these advertisements and the big advantage is the power efficiency as no active bi-directional connection has to be established. The other advantage is, that scanning for BLE advertisements can happen nearly parallel (= very quick one after the other), while a direct connection must be established for at least a few seconds and will then block both involved devices for that time. This is therefore the preferred option, if technically possible (= for the supported sensors). Most of the \u201eolder\u201c BLE-sensor-devices use unencrypted messages, which can be read by all kinds of BLE-devices or even a NRF24L01. With the arrival of \"newer\" sensors came the problem of encrypted data in MiBeacons, which can be decrypted in Tasmota (not yet with the HM-1x). Meanwhile it is possible to get the needed \"bind_key\" with the help of an open-source project: https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html At least the LYWSD03 allows the use of a simple BLE connection without any encrypted authentication and the reading of the sensor data using normal subscription methods to GATT-services (currently used on the HM-1x). This is more power hungry than the passive reading of BLE advertisements. Other sensors like the MJYD2S are not usable without the \"bind_key\". Supported Devices ~ It can not be ruled out, that changes in the device firmware may break the functionality of this driver completely! The naming conventions in the product range of bluetooth sensors in XIAOMI-universe can be a bit confusing. The exact same sensor can be advertised under slightly different names depending on the seller (Mijia, Xiaomi, Cleargrass, ...).

It is possible to do a pairing and get the necessary decryption key (\"bind_key\") here: https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html This project also provides a custom firmware for the LYWSD03MMC, which then becomes an ATC and is supported by Tasmota too. Default ATC-setting will drain the battery more than stock firmware, because of very frequent data sending. This key and the corresponding MAC of the sensor can be injected with the NRFKEY-command (or NRFMJYD2S). It is probably a good idea to save the whole config as RULE like that: rule1 on System # Init do backlog NRFkey 00112233445566778899 AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566 ; NRFkey 00112233445566778899 AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566 ; NRFPage 6 ; NRFUse 0 ; NRFUse 4 endon (key for two sensors, 6 sensors per page in the WebUI, turn off all sensors, turn on LYWS03) LYWSD03MMC sends encrypted sensor data every 10 minutes. As there are no confirmed reports about correct battery presentation of the sensor (always shows 99%), this function is currently not supported. MJYD2S sends motion detection events and 2 discrete illuminance levels (1 lux or 100 lux for a dark or bright environment). Additionally battery level and contiguous time without motion in discrete growing steps (no motion time = NMT). Working principle of Tasmota BLE drivers (>8.5.) The idea is to provide drivers with as many automatic functions as possible. Besides the hardware setup, there are zero or very few things to configure. The sensor namings are based on the original sensor names and shortened if appropriate (Flower care -> Flora). A part of the MAC will be added to the name as a suffix. All sensors are treated as if they are physically connected to the ESP8266 device. For motion and remote control sensors MQTT-messages will be published in (nearly) real time. The ESP32 and the HM-1x-modules are real BLE devices whereas the NRF24L01 (+) is only a generic 2.4 GHz transceiver with very limited capabilities. BLE Sensors using HM-1x ~ This feature is included only in tasmota-sensors.bin Otherwise you must compile your build . Add the following to user_config_override.h : #ifndef USE_HM10 #define USE_HM10 // Add support for HM-10 as a BLE-bridge (+9k3 code) #endif Features ~ Supported sensors will be connected to at a set interval (default interval equals TelePeriod). A subscription is established for 5 seconds and data (e.g. temperature, humidity and battery) is read and reported to an mqtt topic (Dew point is calculated): tele/%topic%/SENSOR = { \"Time\" : \"2020-03-24T12:47:51\" , \"LYWSD03-52680f\" :{ \"Temperature\" : 21.1 , \"Humidity\" : 58.0 , \"DewPoint\" : 12.5 , \"Battery\" : 100 }, \"LYWSD02-a2fd09\" :{ \"Temperature\" : 21.4 , \"Humidity\" : 57.0 , \"DewPoint\" : 12.5 , \"Battery\" : 2 }, \"MJ_HT_V1-d8799d\" :{ \"Temperature\" : 21.4 , \"Humidity\" : 54.6 , \"DewPoint\" : 11.9 }, \"TempUnit\" : \"C\" } After a completed discovery scan, the driver will report the number of found sensors. As Tasmota can not know how many sensors are meant to be discovered you have to force a re-scan until the desired number of devices is found. Rule1 ON HM10 # Found < 6 DO Add1 1 ENDON ON Var1 # State <= 3 DO HM10Scan ENDON This will re-scan up to 3 times if less than 6 sensors are found.

All sensors have an additional GATT-interface with more data in it, but it can not be read with a NRF24l01. As we can not use a checksum to test data integrity of the packet, only data of sensors whose adresses showed up more than once (default = 3 times) will be published. Internally from time to time \"fake\" sensors will be created, when there was data corruption in the address bytes. These will be removed automatically.

It is important to know, that many new devices (nearly every Apple-device) will change its MAC every few minutes to prevent tracking. If the driver receives a packet from the \"beacon\" a counter will be (re-)started with an increment every second. This timer is published in the TELE-message, presented in the webUI and processed as a RULE. The stability of regular readings will be strongly influenced by the local environment (many BLE-devices nearby or general noise in the 2.4-GHz-band). BLE Sensors on ESP32 using built-in Bluetooth ~ You must compile your build for the ESP32. Change the following to user_config_override.h : #ifdef ESP32 #define USE_MI_ESP32 // Add support for ESP32 as a BLE-bridge (+9k2 mem, +292k flash) #endif // ESP8266 To turn on/off support for decyrption, change the following in the driver code: # define USE_MI_DECRYPTION Without encryption support the driver will read data from found LYWSD03MMC via connection. This will increase power consumption of the sensor, but no \"bind_key\" is needed. The driver will start to scan for known sensors automatically using a hybrid approach, when encryption support is deactivated. In the first place MiBeacons are passively received and only found LYWSD03MMC- and MHO-C401-sensors will be connected at the given period to read data in order to be as energy efficient as possible. Battery data is in general of questionable value for the LYWSD0x, CGD1, MHO-C401 and (maybe) Flora (some are even hard coded on the device to 99%). That's why only MJ_HT_V1, CGG1 (untested) and LYWSD03 (calculated battery level) will automatically update battery data. The other battery levels can be read by command. The internally very similiar LYWS03MMC and MHO-C401 behave very confusing in delivering battery status. Both report (fixed) 99% or 100% via encrypted payload or connected reading of the battery characteristic. But they can deliver a correct battery voltage in their payload of the temperature and humidity data, which will be mapped to a percentage level by the driver. Commands Command Parameters MI32Period Show interval in seconds between sensor read cycles for the LYWSD03. Set to TelePeriod value at boot. MI32Time <n> = set time time of a LYWSD02 only sensor to Tasmota UTC time and timezone. <n> is the sensor number in order of discovery starting with 0 (topmost sensor in the webUI list).

The sensors supported by Tasmota use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to transmit the sensor data, but they differ in their accessibilities quite substantially. Basically all of them use of so-called \u201eMiBeacons\u201c which are BLE advertisement packets with a certain data structure, which are broadcasted by the devices automatically while the device is not in an active bluetooth connection. The frequency of these messages is set by the vendor and ranges from one per 3 seconds to one per hour (for the battery status of the LYWSD03MMC). Motion sensors and BLE remote controls start to send when an event is triggered. These packets already contain the sensor data and can be passively received by other devices and will be published regardless if a user decides to read out the sensors via connections or not. Thus the battery life of a BLE sensor is not influenced by reading these advertisements and the big advantage is the power efficiency as no active bi-directional connection has to be established. The other advantage is, that scanning for BLE advertisements can happen nearly parallel (= very quick one after the other), while a direct connection must be established for at least a few seconds and will then block both involved devices for that time. This is therefore the preferred option, if technically possible (= for the supported sensors). Most of the \u201eolder\u201c BLE-sensor-devices use unencrypted messages, which can be read by all kinds of BLE-devices or even a NRF24L01. With the arrival of \"newer\" sensors came the problem of encrypted data in MiBeacons, which can be decrypted in Tasmota (not yet with the HM-1x). Meanwhile it is possible to get the needed \"bind_key\" with the help of an open-source project: https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html At least the LYWSD03 allows the use of a simple BLE connection without any encrypted authentication and the reading of the sensor data using normal subscription methods to GATT-services (currently used on the HM-1x). This is more power hungry than the passive reading of BLE advertisements. Other sensors like the MJYD2S are not usable without the \"bind_key\".","title":"Tasmota and BLE-sensors"},{"location":"Bluetooth/#supported-devices_1","text":"It can not be ruled out, that changes in the device firmware may break the functionality of this driver completely!

Not all devices need all of the available features. ESP based devices have a limited amount of memory available. To ensure that there is enough memory available to flash the firmware, it is best to keep the total size as small as possible, and definitely under 625K total to ensure OTA updates are possible. For this reason, Tasmota makes available the ability to create different firmware binary files to suit each particular device's requirements (e.g., sensors) and each application's needs (e.g., Rules, Timers, etc.). Once features such as support for sensors, rules, timers, etc. is compiled into the firmware binary, the features themselves can be configured at run-time, or, for some features, configured at compile time as well. Many times one just needs to download a pre-compiled binary and perform the necessary run-time configuration. It is not necessary to compile your own binary if these pre-compiled builds meet your needs. These available files provide a simpler approach to get up and going with Tasmota quickly. The binary files available on GitHub are for the current master release version only. These master release binaries are also available from the OTA server . However, the latest development branch code binaries are only available from the development OTA server .

Additional buttons and switches can be wired to a free GPIO and configured in Module or Template settings. Note Other than relays/lights, Tasmota does not publish the state of components (switches, buttons, sensors, etc.) in real-time. State of components is transmitted automatically each TelePeriod via the SENSORS message. Button vs. Switch ~ A button (also called a push-button) is a momentary or non-latching switch which causes a temporary change in the state of an electrical circuit only while the switch is pressed. An automatic mechanism (i.e. a spring) returns the switch to its default position immediately afterwards, restoring the initial circuit condition. A switch (more precisely a latching or toggle switch), when activated by the user, remains in that state until activated again. Learn more about buttons and switches in this video . Both have a similar function, but Tasmota distinguishes between a \"Button\" and a \"Switch\" in other ways. Switch ~ In Tasmota a Switch is any switch or push-button additionally connected to a free GPIO. Some possibilities include: mechanical toggle switch - also called a rocker switch capacitive touch switch reed switch PIR sensor - even though it's technically a sensor it is configured as a switch in Tasmota mechanical push-button By default a switch toggles the corresponding power state (f.e. Switch1 controls Power1 ). Every time the switch gets flipped the power state changes (ON or OFF). Instead of the default toggling of the power state, switches can be configured to send messages to different MQTT topics or send commands to other Tasmota devices. To ignore the default behaviour define a rule which triggers on Switch<x>#State or use Switchtopic . Take note: If the rule matches only certain states, default switch behaviour is supressed only for those states. Example Make Switch1 publish its value to cmnd/custom-topic/SWITCH and not control Power1 Backlog SwitchMode 1 ; SwitchTopic 0 Backlog Rule1 on Switch1 # state do Publish cmnd /% topic %/ SWITCH1 % value % endon ; Rule1 1 Warning If you define a switch with a number higher than available power outputs it will default to controlling Power1 . Example: Switch4 on a device with Power1 and Power2 will control Power1 . And now, to make everything completely confusing: A push-button can be configured as a Switch and a toggle switch can be configured as a Button . Configuring a toggle switch as a Button is not recommended! SwitchMode ~ To change the behavior of a physical input peripheral configured as a Tasmota Switch<x> component, whether a toggle switch or a momentary switch (i.e., a push-button), use the SwitchMode command. If there is more than one Switch<x> component, use SwitchMode<x> where <x> is the number of your switch from the Tasmota GPIO configuration. SwitchMode, as the name implies, applies ONLY to GPIO configured in Tasmota as a Switch<x> component (9-16 & 82-89). SwitchMode has NO impact on the behavior of GPIO configured as Button<x> components (17-20, 90-93, & 112-129). SwitchMode sets the desired behavior of a Switch<x> component based on whether it's a switch or a push-button (i.e., a momentary switch) that is physically connected to the GPIO. SwitchMode 0 Default mode Set switch to toggle mode ( 0 = TOGGLE , 1 = TOGGLE ). Tasmota sends TOGGLE command each time the state of the circuit changes (closing or opening). In case of a push button attached Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when pressed and another TOGGLE command when released. Example When the button is pressed, toggle the power to ring the doorbell; when the button is released, ring the doorbell again. SwitchMode 1 Set switch to follow mode ( 0 = OFF , 1 = ON ) At the time when the circuit is closed, Tasmota will send ON and opening the circuit sends OFF . Tip You want to use SwitchMode 1 when connecting a toggle switch (e.g. a classic light switch) to your device. This way the \"software switch\" will mirror the state of the \"hardware switch\". If the real switch is in the \"ON\" position, the state in Tasmota is ON as well. SwitchMode 2 Set switch to inverted follow mode ( 0 = ON , 1 = OFF ) At the time when the circuit is closed, Tasmota will send OFF and opening the circuit sends ON . Tip When connecting a momentary switch (i.e., a push-button) you will want to use SwitchMode 3..7 . SwitchMode 3 Set push-button mode ( 0 = TOGGLE , 1 = ON ( default )) Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button is released (opening the circuit). When pressing the button (closing the circuit) nothing will happen. Default state is ON and when pressed it's OFF. (This trigger is known as falling-edge ) SwitchMode 4 Set inverted push-button mode ( 0 = OFF ( default ), 1 = TOGGLE ) Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button is pressed (closing the circuit). When the button is released (opening the circuit) nothing will happen. Default state is OFF and when pressed it's ON. (This trigger is known as rising-edge ) SwitchMode 5 Set push-button with long press mode ( 0 = TOGGLE , 1 = ON ( default ), long press = HOLD ) Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button is released (opening the circuit). When pressing the button (closing the circuit) nothing will happen. Default state is ON and when pressed it's OFF. When held for the time set in SetOption32 ( default = 4s ), Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). SwitchMode 6 Set inverted push-button with long press mode ( 0 = OFF ( default ), 1 = TOGGLE , long press = HOLD ) Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button pressed (closing the circuit). When the button is released (opening the circuit) nothing will happen. Default state is OFF and when pressed it's ON. When held for the time set in SetOption32 ( default = 4s ), Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). Long press or hold can be used in conjunction with rules to create additional features or to control another Tasmota device SwitchMode 7 Set toggle push-button mode. Same as SwitchMode 0 . SwitchMode 8 Set switch to multi change toggle mode ( 0 = TOGGLE , 1 = TOGGLE , 2x change = HOLD ). Same as SwitchMode 0 but when the state of the circuit changes within 0.5s twice no TOGGLE commands are send but Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). Warning When you change switch states fast (within 0.5s) some extra actions can be triggered using rules. ON/OFFpower state is only changed when there is no second switch change within 0.5s. SwitchMode 9 Set switch to multi change follow mode ( 0 = OFF , 1 = ON , 2x change = HOLD ) Same as SwitchMode 1 but when the state of the circuit changes within 0.5s twice no OFF/ON commands are send but Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). Warning When you change switch states fast (within 0.5s) some extra actions can be triggered using rules. ON/OFFpower state is only changed when there is no second switch change within 0.5s. SwitchMode 10 Set switch to multi change inverted follow mode ( 0 = ON , 1 = OFF , 2x change = HOLD ) Same as SwitchMode 2 but when the state of the circuit changes within 0.5s twice no ON/OFF commands are send but Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). Warning When you change switch states fast (within 0.5s) some extra actions can be triggered using rules. ON/OFFpower state is only changed when there is no second switch change within 0.5s. SwitchMode 11 Set switch to pushbutton with dimmer mode incl. double press feature Note Setoption32 must be smaller than 64, when you use switchmode 11 and 12 !! Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button is pressed for a short time and then is released (use Switch<x>#state=2 in rules). When pressing the button (closing the circuit) for a long time (set in SetOption32 ), Tasmota will send repeated INC_DEC (increment or decrement the dimmer) commands for as long as the button is pressed (use Switch<x>#state=4 in rules). Two different CLEAR commands are available. An immediate CLEAR command is send upon button release - no delay (use Switch<x>#state=7 in rules). Releasing the button also starts an internal timer (time is set in SetOption32 ). When released for the time set in SetOption32 , Tasmota will send a 'delayed' CLEAR command (use Switch<x>#state=6 in rules). If the button is pressed again before the timeout, Tasmota will send an INV command. The INV command is for the controlling software (Home Assistant) to switch between incrementing and decrementing the dimmer (use Switch<x>#state=5 in rules). If button is pressed twice (within time set in SetOption32 ), Tasmota will send a DOUBLE command. Note that this doesn't change behaviour of other switch states. So along with the DOUBLE command, TOGGLE command will also be fired twice upon a double press (use Switch<x>#state=8 in rules). Tip The dimmer mode has several use cases: In conjunction with rules to create additional features or to control another Tasmota device. In conjunction with ControllerX (HA Appdeamon app) to implement easy toggle and dimming of smart lights, with an 'in wall' hw Tasmota switch. Turn a media player on and off and to control the volume of a media player with one switch. SwitchMode 12 Set switch to inverted pushbutton with dimmer mode incl. double press feature. Same as Switchmode 11 but with inverted behaviour. Note Setoption32 must be smaller than 64, when you use switchmode 11 and 12 !! SwitchMode 13 Set switch to \"push to on\" mode ( 1 = ON , 0 = nothing ) Tasmota will send an ON command when the button pressed (closing the circuit). When the button is released (opening the circuit) nothing will happen. Switch off using PulseTime . SwitchMode 14 Set switch to inverted \"push to on\" mode ( 0 = ON , 1 = nothing ) This mode is useful with PIR sensors SwitchTopic ~ Warning When using SwitchTopic 1 or 2 (or ButtonTopic 1 or 2 ) and your MQTT broker becomes unavailable, Tasmota falls back to default SwitchTopic 0 (or ButtonTopic 0 ), which is not optimal. To avoid this, we recommend using rules . They simply always work! If you still need to use SwitchTopic read on! SwitchTopic 0 Default mode By default a switch controls the corresponding power state and doesn't send any MQTT messages itself. No MQTT message will be published on account of the new switch state. The message you see in console is the new power state that is controlled and not the switch state. SwitchTopic 1 Sets MQTT switch topic to device %topic% When changing the state of the switch an MQTT message is sent to the device topic with the payload according to SwitchMode set. Example Device topic tasmota with SwitchMode 3 yields the following message: MQT: cmnd/tasmota/POWER = TOGGLE Notice the cmnd instead of the stat at the beginning. This is the same as sending an MQTT commands to this device, the device power state will be set to the defined state. SwitchTopic <value> Set switch topic to a custom topic (32 characters max) This will send an MQTT message to a custom defined topic similarly to option 1. In the following example, we set the topic to tasmota02 with SwitchTopic tasmota02 . Example Device topic tasmota with SwitchMode 1 and custom topic tasmota02 yields the following message: MQT: cmnd/tasmota02/POWER = ON If you have another device with the topic tasmota02 this action will turn on its power while not affecting anything on the tasmota device. SwitchTopic Summary SwitchTopic 0 controls the power state directly. SwitchTopic 1 sends an MQTT message to the device topic. This sets the state of the devices power accordingly. SwitchTopic <value> sends an MQTT message command to the custom topic. This does not change the state of the devices power. Button ~ For Tasmota, a Button is typically a momentary push-button (or a capacitive touch button in some light switches). By default a button toggles the corresponding power state. Every time the button gets pressed a relay or light changes its Power state (ON or OFF). Besides toggling the Power state, a button is also used to activate multi press button functions , to do long press (HOLD) actions, or send messages to different MQTT topics. A push-to-make button should use a Button<x> component while a push-to-break button should use Button<x>i (i.e., inverted). To ignore default button behaviour of controlling power outputs you can: use SetOption73 1 use ButtonTopic define a rule which triggers on Button<x>#State . Take note: If the rule trigger only certain states, default behaviour is supressed only for those states. Make Button1 publish its value to cmnd/custom-topic/BUTTON and not control Power1 Backlog ButtonTopic 0 Rule1 on Button1 # state do Publish cmnd / custom - topic / BUTTON % value % endon Rule1 1 Multi-Press Functions ~ Multipress functions for 2 and more presses cannot be changed using SetOptions or rules. Danger If you have changed ButtonTopic , SetOption1 , SetOption11 or SetOption13 some of the listed functionality will be changed or removed. Note Button1 can directly control up to five relays. The number of the activated relay corresponds to the number of button presses and this feature is not present in the other buttons. When ButtonTopic is set to default 0 a button will always send its state for rules. 1 short press Toggles the power state. This will blink the LED once and send an MQTT status message like stat/tasmota/POWER = ON or another one like stat/tasmota/BUTTON<x> = {\"ACTION\":\"SINGLE\"} when SetOption73 is enabled. The button state for rules is 2 ( 10 if Setoption73 is enabled). 2 short presses When using Button1 toggles the second power state (if available on the device). This will blink the LED twice and send an MQTT status message like stat/tasmota/POWER2 = ON or another one like stat/tasmota/BUTTON<x> = {\"ACTION\":\"DOUBLE\"} when SetOption73 is enabled. The button state for rules is 11 . 3 short presses When using Button1 toggles the third power state (if available on the device). This will blink the LED three times and send an MQTT status message like stat/tasmota/POWER3 = ON or another one like stat/tasmota/BUTTON<x> = {\"ACTION\":\"TRIPLE\"} when SetOption73 is enabled. The button state for rules is 12 . 4 short presses When using Button1 toggles the fourth power state (if available on the device). This will blink the LED for times and send an MQTT status message like stat/tasmota/POWER4 = ON or another one like stat/tasmota/BUTTON<x> = {\"ACTION\":\"QUAD\"} when SetOption73 is enabled. The button state for rules is 13 . 5 short presses When using Button1 toggles the fifth power state (if available on the device). This will blink the LED five times and send an MQTT status message like stat/tasmota/POWER5 = ON or another one like stat/tasmota/BUTTON<x> = {\"ACTION\":\"PENTA\"} when SetOption73 is enabled. The button state for rules is 14 . 6 short presses Start WifiConfig 2 . Can be disabled using SetOption1 1 Long press There are two separate functions associated with a button long press based on how long it is held: When held continuously for 40 seconds (Configurable with SetOption32 , value is 10x the configured hold time) Tasmota will reset to firmware defaults and restart. If enabled, button pressed for 4 seconds (Configurable with SetOption32 ) creates a HOLD action and send an MQTT status message like stat/tasmota/BUTTON<x> = {\"ACTION\":\"HOLD\"} when SetOption73 is enabled. The button state for rules is 3 . If ButtonRetain has been enabled the MQTT message will also contain the MQTT retain flag. Danger When a button is configured as inverted or with a Switchmode that keeps it as ON while depressed it activates the reset to firmware defaults function. Change the Button configuration or SwitchMode to avoid repeated reset to defaults or use Setoption1 1 to disable that function. Warning If you define a button with a number higher than available power outputs it will default to controlling Power1 . Example: Button4 on a device with Power1 and Power2 will control Power1 . ButtonTopic ~ ButtonTopic 0 Default option By default a button controls the corresponding power state and doesn't send any MQTT messages itself. No MQTT message will be published on account of the new button state. The message you see in console is the new power state that is controlled and not the button state. ButtonTopic 1 Sets MQTT button topic to device %topic%. When changing the state of the button an MQTT message is sent to the device topic with the payload according to SwitchMode set. Example Device topic tasmota with SwitchMode 3 yields the following message: MQT: cmnd/tasmota/POWER = ON Notice the cmnd instead of the stat at the beginning. This is the same as sending an MQTT command to this device, the device power state will be set to the defined state. ButtonTopic <value> Set button topic to a custom topic (32 characters max). This will send an MQTT message to a custom defined topic similarly to option 1. Example For example, we set the topic to tasmota02 with ButtonTopic tasmota02 . With SwitchMode 1 the device yields the following message: MQT: cmnd/tasmota02/POWER = TOGGLE If you have another device with the topic tasmota02 this action will toggle its power state while not affecting anything on the tasmota device. ButtonTopic Summary ButtonTopic 0 controls the power state directly. ButtonTopic 1 sends an MQTT message to the device topic. This sets the state of the devices power state accordingly. ButtonTopic <value> sends an MQTT message command to the custom topic. This does not change the state of the devices power state. When a Button is set to a different topic than 0 is not possible to use Button#State as a trigger for rules. Changing Default Functionality ~ If a ButtonTopic (and if SetOption1 1 ) or SwitchTopic 1 is defined (and SwitchMode is set to 5 or 6 ) and a button is pressed longer than defined Key Hold Time ( SetOption32 default 4 seconds) an MQTT message like cmnd/%topic%/POWER HOLD will be sent. HOLD can be changed with StateText4 . Command SetOption11 allows for swapping the functionality between the SINGLE and DOUBLE press of the push button. These changes result in the following: Example You can control a ceiling fan from a Sonoff Touch: If your standard topic of Sonoff Touch is light and the ceiling fan topic is ceilingfan issue these commands on the Sonoff Touch to activate the double press feature. ButtonTopic ceilingfan SetOption11 1 All of the above is easier accomplished using Rules ! AC Frequency Detection Switch ~ Some devices, such as BlitzWolf BW-SS5 or Moes MS-104B , use mains frequency detection on their switch inputs. Whenever the connected switch or button is pressed there are 50/60 Hz pulses on the switch input. Inside the switch there's a frequency detection circuit which is connected to a GPIO of the ESP8266 chip which counts those pulses. Prior to Tasmota 8.4 this kind of switching was handled using Counter sensors and scripting which is now simplified. You can imagine this algorithm as a leaking bucket. Every pulse adds water to the bucket (little more than leaking out in a cycle), but the water is dripping countinously. If the bucket is full, we will treat the switch on. If there's no pulses, the bucket will be empty, and the we will turn off the switch. The size of the bucket is the debouncing time which controls the sensitivity of the algorithm. If the mains frequency is 50 Hz, a whole AC wave is 20 msec long (for 60 Hz it's about 17 msec; 1000 / frequeny if we want the result in milliseconds). The exact frequency is not really important, because we add more water for every pulse. After you have assigned a Switch<x> to the GPIO connected to the AC frequency detection circuit use the 'SwitchDebounce' command to set the number of pulses required for the switch to be recognized as on or off. For example: SwitchDebounce 69 will turn the switch on after three pulses and turn it off after three missing ones (3 * 20 msec is 60 and the last digit must be 9 to activate the AC detection). You will probably have to experiment with the values depending on your AC frequency and the devices frequency detection implementation. Once the feature is enabled you can use this switch as any regular switch! For a practical application of everything mentioned in this article read about this excellent LEGO nightstand switch project .","title":"Buttons and Switches"},{"location":"Buttons-and-Switches/#button-vs-switch","text":"A button (also called a push-button) is a momentary or non-latching switch which causes a temporary change in the state of an electrical circuit only while the switch is pressed. An automatic mechanism (i.e. a spring) returns the switch to its default position immediately afterwards, restoring the initial circuit condition. A switch (more precisely a latching or toggle switch), when activated by the user, remains in that state until activated again. Learn more about buttons and switches in this video . Both have a similar function, but Tasmota distinguishes between a \"Button\" and a \"Switch\" in other ways.","title":"Button vs. Switch"},{"location":"Buttons-and-Switches/#switch","text":"In Tasmota a Switch is any switch or push-button additionally connected to a free GPIO. Some possibilities include: mechanical toggle switch - also called a rocker switch capacitive touch switch reed switch PIR sensor - even though it's technically a sensor it is configured as a switch in Tasmota mechanical push-button By default a switch toggles the corresponding power state (f.e. Switch1 controls Power1 ). Every time the switch gets flipped the power state changes (ON or OFF). Instead of the default toggling of the power state, switches can be configured to send messages to different MQTT topics or send commands to other Tasmota devices. To ignore the default behaviour define a rule which triggers on Switch<x>#State or use Switchtopic . Take note: If the rule matches only certain states, default switch behaviour is supressed only for those states. Example Make Switch1 publish its value to cmnd/custom-topic/SWITCH and not control Power1 Backlog SwitchMode 1 ; SwitchTopic 0 Backlog Rule1 on Switch1 # state do Publish cmnd /% topic %/ SWITCH1 % value % endon ; Rule1 1 Warning If you define a switch with a number higher than available power outputs it will default to controlling Power1 . Example: Switch4 on a device with Power1 and Power2 will control Power1 . And now, to make everything completely confusing: A push-button can be configured as a Switch and a toggle switch can be configured as a Button . Configuring a toggle switch as a Button is not recommended!","title":"Switch"},{"location":"Buttons-and-Switches/#switchmode","text":"To change the behavior of a physical input peripheral configured as a Tasmota Switch<x> component, whether a toggle switch or a momentary switch (i.e., a push-button), use the SwitchMode command. If there is more than one Switch<x> component, use SwitchMode<x> where <x> is the number of your switch from the Tasmota GPIO configuration. SwitchMode, as the name implies, applies ONLY to GPIO configured in Tasmota as a Switch<x> component (9-16 & 82-89). SwitchMode has NO impact on the behavior of GPIO configured as Button<x> components (17-20, 90-93, & 112-129). SwitchMode sets the desired behavior of a Switch<x> component based on whether it's a switch or a push-button (i.e., a momentary switch) that is physically connected to the GPIO. SwitchMode 0 Default mode Set switch to toggle mode ( 0 = TOGGLE , 1 = TOGGLE ). Tasmota sends TOGGLE command each time the state of the circuit changes (closing or opening). In case of a push button attached Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when pressed and another TOGGLE command when released. Example When the button is pressed, toggle the power to ring the doorbell; when the button is released, ring the doorbell again. SwitchMode 1 Set switch to follow mode ( 0 = OFF , 1 = ON ) At the time when the circuit is closed, Tasmota will send ON and opening the circuit sends OFF . Tip You want to use SwitchMode 1 when connecting a toggle switch (e.g. a classic light switch) to your device. This way the \"software switch\" will mirror the state of the \"hardware switch\". If the real switch is in the \"ON\" position, the state in Tasmota is ON as well. SwitchMode 2 Set switch to inverted follow mode ( 0 = ON , 1 = OFF ) At the time when the circuit is closed, Tasmota will send OFF and opening the circuit sends ON . Tip When connecting a momentary switch (i.e., a push-button) you will want to use SwitchMode 3..7 . SwitchMode 3 Set push-button mode ( 0 = TOGGLE , 1 = ON ( default )) Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button is released (opening the circuit). When pressing the button (closing the circuit) nothing will happen. Default state is ON and when pressed it's OFF. (This trigger is known as falling-edge ) SwitchMode 4 Set inverted push-button mode ( 0 = OFF ( default ), 1 = TOGGLE ) Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button is pressed (closing the circuit). When the button is released (opening the circuit) nothing will happen. Default state is OFF and when pressed it's ON. (This trigger is known as rising-edge ) SwitchMode 5 Set push-button with long press mode ( 0 = TOGGLE , 1 = ON ( default ), long press = HOLD ) Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button is released (opening the circuit). When pressing the button (closing the circuit) nothing will happen. Default state is ON and when pressed it's OFF. When held for the time set in SetOption32 ( default = 4s ), Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). SwitchMode 6 Set inverted push-button with long press mode ( 0 = OFF ( default ), 1 = TOGGLE , long press = HOLD ) Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button pressed (closing the circuit). When the button is released (opening the circuit) nothing will happen. Default state is OFF and when pressed it's ON. When held for the time set in SetOption32 ( default = 4s ), Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). Long press or hold can be used in conjunction with rules to create additional features or to control another Tasmota device SwitchMode 7 Set toggle push-button mode. Same as SwitchMode 0 . SwitchMode 8 Set switch to multi change toggle mode ( 0 = TOGGLE , 1 = TOGGLE , 2x change = HOLD ). Same as SwitchMode 0 but when the state of the circuit changes within 0.5s twice no TOGGLE commands are send but Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). Warning When you change switch states fast (within 0.5s) some extra actions can be triggered using rules. ON/OFFpower state is only changed when there is no second switch change within 0.5s. SwitchMode 9 Set switch to multi change follow mode ( 0 = OFF , 1 = ON , 2x change = HOLD ) Same as SwitchMode 1 but when the state of the circuit changes within 0.5s twice no OFF/ON commands are send but Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). Warning When you change switch states fast (within 0.5s) some extra actions can be triggered using rules. ON/OFFpower state is only changed when there is no second switch change within 0.5s. SwitchMode 10 Set switch to multi change inverted follow mode ( 0 = ON , 1 = OFF , 2x change = HOLD ) Same as SwitchMode 2 but when the state of the circuit changes within 0.5s twice no ON/OFF commands are send but Tasmota sends HOLD (use Switch<x>#state=3 in rules). Warning When you change switch states fast (within 0.5s) some extra actions can be triggered using rules. ON/OFFpower state is only changed when there is no second switch change within 0.5s. SwitchMode 11 Set switch to pushbutton with dimmer mode incl. double press feature Note Setoption32 must be smaller than 64, when you use switchmode 11 and 12 !! Tasmota will send a TOGGLE command when the button is pressed for a short time and then is released (use Switch<x>#state=2 in rules). When pressing the button (closing the circuit) for a long time (set in SetOption32 ), Tasmota will send repeated INC_DEC (increment or decrement the dimmer) commands for as long as the button is pressed (use Switch<x>#state=4 in rules). Two different CLEAR commands are available. An immediate CLEAR command is send upon button release - no delay (use Switch<x>#state=7 in rules). Releasing the button also starts an internal timer (time is set in SetOption32 ). When released for the time set in SetOption32 , Tasmota will send a 'delayed' CLEAR command (use Switch<x>#state=6 in rules). If the button is pressed again before the timeout, Tasmota will send an INV command. The INV command is for the controlling software (Home Assistant) to switch between incrementing and decrementing the dimmer (use Switch<x>#state=5 in rules). If button is pressed twice (within time set in SetOption32 ), Tasmota will send a DOUBLE command. Note that this doesn't change behaviour of other switch states. So along with the DOUBLE command, TOGGLE command will also be fired twice upon a double press (use Switch<x>#state=8 in rules). Tip The dimmer mode has several use cases: In conjunction with rules to create additional features or to control another Tasmota device. In conjunction with ControllerX (HA Appdeamon app) to implement easy toggle and dimming of smart lights, with an 'in wall' hw Tasmota switch. Turn a media player on and off and to control the volume of a media player with one switch. SwitchMode 12 Set switch to inverted pushbutton with dimmer mode incl. double press feature. Same as Switchmode 11 but with inverted behaviour. Note Setoption32 must be smaller than 64, when you use switchmode 11 and 12 !! SwitchMode 13 Set switch to \"push to on\" mode ( 1 = ON , 0 = nothing ) Tasmota will send an ON command when the button pressed (closing the circuit). When the button is released (opening the circuit) nothing will happen. Switch off using PulseTime . SwitchMode 14 Set switch to inverted \"push to on\" mode ( 0 = ON , 1 = nothing ) This mode is useful with PIR sensors","title":"SwitchMode"},{"location":"Buttons-and-Switches/#switchtopic","text":"Warning When using SwitchTopic 1 or 2 (or ButtonTopic 1 or 2 ) and your MQTT broker becomes unavailable, Tasmota falls back to default SwitchTopic 0 (or ButtonTopic 0 ), which is not optimal.

Flash it with CC2530 firmware and it will work in serial mode. You will have to wire it for serial communication using TX and RX pins, USB port cannot be used for communicating with the CC2531 chip. Wi-Fi Adapter ~ Using an ESP82xx device such as a Wemos D1 Mini or a NodeMCU to flash the CC2530 is a lower cost alternative than using a single purpose CC_DEBUGGER . In normal operation two free GPIOs are needed for the serial communication with the CC2530. Custom PCBs ~ These PCBs make all the connections required to flash the CC2530 and to run Z2T: SuperHouse.tv Jon Oxer created a custom PCB to connect a Wemos D1 Mini and a CC2530 board (with or without CC2591).

Due to memory constraints of the CC2530, you can only pair 16 devices to a coordinator ( See details ). Note There is an alternative firmware allowing for Zigbee routers to create a mesh network and go beyond 16 devices. This is currently not tested nor supported by Zigbee2Tasmota. It may be added later. Flashing options: Flashing with CCLoader and ESP8266 (recommended) Flashing with CCLib and ESP8266 Flash with a dedicated CC Debugger and PC Flash Tasmota ~ Once the flashing process completes, you can re-use the ESP82xx and flash Tasmota with Zigbee2Tasmota enabled firmware. Otherwise, you can use any ESP82xx device. Zigbee feature is not included in precompiled binaries To use it you must compile your build . Add the following to user_config_override.h : #define USE_ZIGBEE Optional Run the ESP at 160MHz instead of 80MHz which ensures higher reliability in serial communication with CC2530. In platformio_override.ini uncomment line 51: board_build.f_cpu = 160000000L If you find that your Zigbee2Tasmota operation is unstable, you may have an ESP82xx device that cannot operate reliably at the higher frequency. If you are using hardware serial (see below) and you still have unreliability, try compiling for 80MHz (reverse the options above) and flash the ESP82xx device again to see if operating at a lower frequency improves stability. Running at 80MHz will impact software serial communications so hardware serial is highly recommended if running the ESP82xx at 80MHz. Flash the newly compiled binary usig the normal flashing process . Connect CC2530 to Tasmota ~ If you are using your ESP82xx device to flash the Zigbee adapter as described in tutorials you may want to leave these connections in place in case you ever need to update Zigbee firmware. If not, any of the free GPIOs can be used. It is recommended that hardware serial pins be used (GPIO1/GPIO3 or GPIO13[Rx]/GPIO15[Tx]) Due to ESP82xx GPIO pin constraints, GPIO15 can only be used as serial Tx. The interface between the ESP82xx Wi-Fi device and the Zigbee module uses high speed serial. Tip Tasmota also provides serial communications emulation through software (i.e., software serial). This allows any GPIO to be used. TasmotaSerial version 2.4.x (PR #6377 ) has improved the reliability of software serial making it feasible for use in this application.

Power returns the status of first defined power output (usually Relay1)\" Instead of 0 you can use off or false and instead of 1 you can use on or true . Power ON turns first defined power output (usually Relay1) on Power1 1 also turns first defined power output (usually Relay1) on Power1 True also turns first defined power output (usually Relay1) on Replace <x> in a command with the appropriate index number. Leave it empty to use the first available. Power1 and Power both control first defined power output (usually Relay1) In commands with x..y value parameters use a number from x to y range. When a command mentions resetting to \"firmware default\" it means the setting will revert to the one in the flashed binary file. If you used user_config_override.h at compile time it will revert to those. Note Beside results initiated by a command (synchronous) you can get asynchronous results initiated by rule trigger, telemetry event, commands from other source or changed device values. Simply put, other messages may precede messages published as a result of your commands. Example A tele/%topic%/STATUS message (sent every 300 seconds by default) may appear exactly after you issue Power off command and before you receive stat/%topic%/RESULT = {\"POWER\":\"OFF\"} message. with MQTT ~ To send commands and view responses you'll need an MQTT client . Commands over MQTT are issued by using cmnd/%topic%/<command> <parameter> where %topic% is the topic of the device you're sending the command to. If there is no <parameter> (an empty MQTT message/payload), a query is sent for current status of the <command> . See MQTT article to find out more. with Web Requests ~ Commands can be executed via web (HTTP) requests, for example: http://<ip>/cm?cmnd=Power%20TOGGLE http://<ip>/cm?cmnd=Power%20On http://<ip>/cm?cmnd=Power%20off http://<ip>/cm?user=admin&password=joker&cmnd=Power%20Toggle Any spaces or special characters must be replaced with their ASCII hex codes . You must precede each hex code with % . Most used codes are: space = %20 and ; = %3B . Tip Use URLencoder.org to easily convert your commands. If you have set a password for web user interface access, this must be included (in plaintext) in the URL of the HTTP request, like so: http://<ip>/cm?user=<username>&password=<password>&cmnd=Power%20On in Console in the Web UI ~ Console menu in the web UI is a convenient place to send commands and it behaves similar to a terminal connection via serial bridge. Warning The GUI controls do not and can not have all the features and commands implemented. For precise and complete control use Console commands! over Serial Bridge ~ If you flashed the device via serial method you can connect to it with a terminal application (e.g. Termite or Arduino IDE Serial Monitor) to issue commands and follow responses. This is a practical way to do a Backlog setup of your new device. Serial interface is set to 115200 bps except for devices that require a different baudrate the Power of Backlog ~ Backlog command allows executing up to 30 consecutive commands with a single command line. Each command is separated by a semicolon (\";\"). Backlog is a useful feature to avoid numerous restarts when setting up a new device. You can use it to: Set up both Wi-Fi AP's Backlog SSID1 < myssid > ; Password1 < mypassword > ; SSID2 < myssid2 > ; Password2 < mypassword2 > Configure MQTT broker address, MQTT credentials, device topic and activate a few custom options Backlog MqttHost < yourhost > ; MqttUser < user > ; MqttPassword < password > ; Topic < customtopic > ; SetOption53 1 ; PowerRetain on For specific power control, using backlog like a script Backlog Status 1 ; Power2 on ; Delay 20 ; Power2 off ; Status 4 When using web requests (Don't forget to encode \"space\" as '%20' and \";\" as '%3B') http://<ip>/cm?user=admin&password=joker&cmnd=Backlog%20Power%20Toggle%3BPower1%20ff A Backlog command without an argument clears an possible existing Backlog queue. Example in case of command Backlog Power1 OFF; Delay 600; Power1 ON the usage of an additional Backlog command without any argument within the delay time of 1 minute will delete the whole queue Power1 OFF; Delay 600; Power1 ON . Therefore Power1 ON command will not be executed and the power would remain off. Commands List ~ Warning If you're using Tasmota versions earlier current release some of the commands might not work. Availability of some features and their associated commands depend on the firmware build. Please consult the builds table for a reference of which features are available for each firmware variant. Note Almost all settings using string parameters (except Rule and MqttFingerprint ) share a common area with max 698 chars, i.e. the total length of all these parameters is limited to this size (you will be noted if this limit is exceeded). Control ~ Command Parameters Backlog List of commands to be executed in sequence separated by ; See Using Backlog for examples. BlinkCount Number of relay toggles ( blinks ) (does not control the status LED) 0 = blink many times before restoring power state 1..32000 = set number of blinks (default = 10 ) BlinkTime 2..3600 set duration, in 0.1 second increments, to blink aka toggle Power (does not control the status LED) ButtonDebounce User control over button debounce timing 40..1000 = set button debounce time in milliseconds (default = 50 ) Buzzer 0 = stop active buzzer cycle <count>,<beep>,<silence>,<tune> = read more... 2,3 = Beep twice with 300 milliseconds duration and 100 milliseconds pause 2,3,4 = Beep twice with 300 milliseconds duration and 400 milliseconds pause 1,2,3,0xF54 (0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 0101 0100). Each 1 bit beeps for 200 milliseconds and each bounded 0 bit pauses for 300 milliseconds -1 = infinite mode -2 = follow LED mode DevGroupName<x> 0 = clear device group <x> name and restart <value> = set device group <x> name and restart. Prior to 8.2.0.3, GroupTopic was used to specify the device group name DevGroupSend<x> <item>=<value>[ ...] = send an update to device group <x>. The device group name must have been previously set with DevGroupName<x>. Multiple item/value pairs can be specified separated by a space. Spaces in <value> must be escaped with a backslash (\\). The message sent is also processed on the local device as if it had been received from the network. For items with numeric values, <value> can be specified as @<operator>[<operand>] to send a value after performing an operation on the current value. <operator> can be + (add), - (subtract) or ^ (invert). If <operand> is not specified, it defaults to 0xffffffff for the invert operator and 1 for other operators. 2 = Light fade (0 = Off, 1 = On) 3 = Light speed (1..40) 4 = Light brightness (0..255) 5 = Light Scheme 6 = Light fixed color (0 = white (using CT channels), other values according to Color Command ) 7 = PWM dimmer low preset (0..255) 8 = PWM dimmer high preset (0..255) 9 = PWM dimmer power-on brightness (0..255) 128 = Relay Power - bitmask with bits set for relays to be powered on.

DevGroupSend 193=Buzzer\\\\ 2,3 - send the Buzzer 2,3 command. DevGroupSend 6=@+ 4=@-10 - set the next fixed color and decrease the brightness by 10. DevGroupSend 128=^ - toggle all the relays. DevGroupShare <in>,<out> = set incoming and outgoing shared items (default = 0xffffffff,0xffffffff ) . <in> and <out> are bit masks where each mask is the sum of the values for the categories (listed below) to be shared. For example, to receive only power (1), light brightness (2) and light color (16) and send only power (1), enter the command DevGroupShare 19,1. 1 = Power 2 = Light brightness 4 = Light fade/speed 8 = Light scheme 16 = Light color 32 = Dimmer settings (presets) 64 = Event DevGroupStatus<x> Show the status of device group <x> including a list of the currently known members.

Counter module configuration is using internal pull-up resistor while Counter n does not. * CounterDebounce 0 = turn off counter debounce 1..32000 = set counter debounce time in milliseconds. Counter is increased with every falling edge when CounterType =0 or time between successive falling edges is measured when CounterType =1. When CounterDebounceLow and CounterDebounceHigh are set to zero (default) only falling edges of the counter's GPIO are checked. Any CounterDebounceLow or CounterDebounceHigh unequal zero checks are carried out befor CounterDebounce check is done. As an example you can set CounterDebounce 500 to allow a minimum distance between to succesive valid falling edges equal to 500ms. CounterDebounceLow 0 = turn off counter debounce low 1..32000 = set counter debounce low time in milliseconds. Allow individual debounce times for low pulse widths to discard non valid falling edges. These are checked before legacy CounterDebounce checks distance between two valid falling edges. When unequal zero tasmota will check falling and rising edges on the counter's GPIO. For CounterDebounceLow any GPIO change from low to high hat happens after the GPIO was not low for at least CounterDebounceLow will be ignored. As an example you can set CounterDebounceLow 50 to allow a valid minimum distance between a falling and rising edge equal to 50ms while having a final CounterDebounce 500 check between to succesive valid falling edges equal to 500ms. CounterDebounceHigh 0 = turn off counter debounce high 1..32000 = set counter debounce high time in milliseconds. Allow individual debounce times for high pulse widths to discard non valid falling edges. These are checked before legacy CounterDebounce checks distance between two valid falling edges. When unequal zero tasmota will check falling and rising edges on the counter's GPIO. For CounterDebounceHigh any GPIO change from high to low hat happens after the GPIO was not high for at least CounterDebounceHigh will be ignored. As an example you can set CounterDebounceHigh 100 to allow a valid minimum distance between a rising and falling edge equal to 100ms while having a final CounterDebounce 500 check between to succesive valid falling edges equal to 500ms.

Hardware Serial Bridge uses GPIO1 (Tx) and GPIO3 (Rx) or GPIO13 (Tx) and GPIO15 (Rx) pins of your device. Software Serial Bridge can use any other GPIO to be configured as components Serial Tx and Serial Rx (or SerBr Tx and SerBr Rx ). If Tx and Rx components are not assigned in the Template or Module, GPIO1 and GPIO3 will be used. Note that changing serial logging ( SerialLog 0) will disable the hardware Serial Bridge. Information received by Tasmota over the serial bridge is captured automatically. Before data will be received, a properly formatted SerialSend<x> or SSerialSend<x> command must be executed. This must be done any time the device restarts (e.g., via a System#Boot triggered rule). This command is required in order to set how the expected serial data will be formatted and interpreted (i.e., which <x> option). A {\"SSerialReceived\":{\"Data\":\"<string>\"}} message will be posted. You can use a rule to process the string which will be contained in SSerialReceived#Data . Expect possible communication errors when additional sensors are configured. Command Parameters Baudrate 1 = set hardware serial bridge to default baud rate of 115200 bps <value> = set baud rate. The set rate will be a multiple of 300. The maximum baud rate possible is 19,660,500. SBaudrate 1 = set software serial bridge to default baud rate of 9600 bps <value> = set baud rate. The set rate will be a multiple of 300. The maximum baud rate possible is 19,660,500.

To control shutter #1 by a single button: ShutterButton1 1 updown 0 assigns button #1 to act as an \"up and down\" button (1x press up, 2x press down). To control shutter #1 by a single button: ShutterButton1 1 toggle 0 assigns button #1 to act as a \"toggle\" button (1x press toggle, 2x press 50% position). ShutterCalibration<x> Granular shutter position calibration. The measured opening position of the shutter at the 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100 percent opened locations. For example: ShutterCalibration<x> 23 38 56 74 82 ShutterCloseDuration<x> 1..255 (default = 10 ) time, in seconds, it takes to fully close the shutter. A fraction of a second can be specified (e.g. 45.7 ). ShutterClose<x> Engage the relay to close the shutter. This action can be requested at any time. Number of shutter can be the index or the arguement ShutterFrequency<x> 0..10,000 Hz (default = 1000 ) the maximum frequency at which the stepper motor can operate reliably. Typically this is up to 2,000Hz with a 12V power supply and up to 5,000Hz with a 24V power supply. ShutterEnableEndStopTime<x> 0 = no additional shutter end stop time (default) 1 = 1 s additional shutter end stop time ShutterInvert<x> 0 = use default shutter positioning ( 0 = Closed, 100 = Open) 1 = invert shutter positioning ( 100 = Closed, 0 = Open) (e.g., if used with KNX) ShutterInvertWebButtons<x> 0 = use default button icons (\u25b2 for open, \u25bc for close) 1 = invert button icons (\u25bc for open, \u25b2 for close) (e.g., if used with horizontal awning: where open means rolling-down fabric material and close rolling-up in a protect position) ShutterLock<x> 0 = unlock shutter positioning (default) 1 = lock shutter positioning ShutterMotorDelay<x> 0.00 .. 12.75 (default = 0 ) time, in seconds, it takes the motor to start moving once power is turned on; i.e., motor lag time. When used with stepper motors, this setting defines the ramp up/down speed (i.e., acceleration/deceleration) before the motor reaches its target speed for gradual starting and stopping. ShutterOpenDuration<x> 1..255 (default = 10 ) time, in seconds, it takes to fully open the shutter. A fraction of a second can be specified (e.g. 45.7 ). ShutterOpen<x> Engage the relay to open the shutter. This action can be requested at any time. Number of shutter can be index or the arguement ShutterPosition<x> 0..100 , UP , DOWN , STOP A shutter position change can be requested at any time. The shutter will stop and revert or update to the requested position. The shutter's actual position will be saved after the movement is completed. In this case, the position will be restored during reboot. An interruption during shutter movement (e.g., a device restart) will lose the current position. ShutterMove<x> -100..100 Moves the shutter from the current position relativly in %. If the resulting position is below 0 or above 100 it will be capped. Command can also be executed during movement and will change the target position. ShutterPWMRange<x> 0..1023,0..1023 For servo motors the min and max position is defined by the length of the duty cycle signal. Because every servo is different the min and max PWM value must be set for each servo type. The value is also dependend on the PWMfrequency . Servos normally use 50..200 as PWMfrequency . ShutterRelay<x> <value> 0 = disable this and all higher numbered shutters Relay<value> component used to open the shutter. This relay's mate, the next higher numbered relay, closes the shutter. Depending on the shutter mode, the relays may need to be interlocked using the Interlock command. The ShutterRelay command must be executed first before any other shutter commands for Shutter<x> can be executed. ShutterSetClose<x> shutter closed position. ShutterPosition will be reset to fully closed value (e.g., 0 when ShutterInvert = 0 , 100 otherwise). ShutterSetOpen<x> shutter opened position. ShutterPosition will be reset to fully opened value (e.g., 100 when ShutterInvert = 0 , 0 otherwise). ShutterSetHalfway<x> 0..100 (default = 50 ) Define shutter half open position (in percent) ShutterStop<x> Disengage the relays to stop the shutter. Number of shutter can be the index or the argument ShutterStopClose<x> Stop the shutter when currently moving, close it otherwise ShutterStopOpen<x> Stop the shutter when currently moving, open it otherwise ShutterStopPosition<x> Stop the shutter when currently moving, set it to position 0..100 , UP , DOWN , STOP , TOGGLE otherwise ShutterStopToggle<x> Stop the shutter when currently moving, do ShutterToggle otherwise ShutterStopToggleDir<x> Stop the shutter when currently moving, do ShutterToggleDir otherwise ShutterToggle<x> Toggle the shutter - close the shutter when its position is >50, open it otherwise ShutterToggleDir<x> Toggle the shutter - close the shutter when it previously moved to open, open it otherwise See also SetOption80 - Enable shutter support Zigbee ~ See Zigbee article for more information Command Parameters <device> As <device> in following commands you can use interchangeably: <shortaddr> = short address of the Zigbee device on the network, example: 0x1234 <longaddr> = permanent IEEE address of the Zigbee device (64 bits), example: 0x00158D00041160C5 <index> = number of the device in the internal list (starts at 1), ideal for enumerating devices, example: 3 for third device in the list <name> = friendly name. Only when previously set with ZbName ZbBind Binds one Zigbee device to another device or to a group. This allows one device to directly send commands (f.e. a remote to a bulb) without any action on the coordinator. Command structure: {\"Device\":\"<device>\", \"Endpoint\":<endpoint>, \"Cluster\":<cluster>, \"ToDevice\":\"<to_device>\", \"ToEndpoint\":<to_endpoint>, \"ToGroup\":<to_group> } <device> = device sending messages (mandatory) <endpoint> = source endpoint (mandatory) <cluster> = source cluster id (mandatory) <to_device> = target device (optional) <to_endpoint> = target endpoint \u2003(optional if it can be inferred from ZbStatus3 ) <to_group> = target group id (optional) You must specify either \"ToDevice\" or \"ToGroup\" but not both Zigbee2Tasmota must know the IEEE address of target device, see ZbStatus2 to verify and ZbProbe to have Zigbee2Tasmota query the address ZbBindState<n> Asks the device for its internal binding states <device> the device to query <n> the start index for the request, 1 is the default.

ZbPermitJoin Sets pairing mode for new device discovery 0 = disable pairing mode 1 = enable pairing mode for 60 seconds 99 = enable pairing until device reboots (CC2530 only) Leaving Zigbee network open to join will allow any Zigbee device to connect and retrieve your network encryption key. This can lead to a compromise of your Zigbee network. ZbPing <device> = test availability of Zigbee device. If the device is connected and not sleeping, you should receive a ZbPing message within the next second. Example: ZbPing 0x5ADF responds with: {\"ZbPing\":{\"Device\":\"0x5ADF\",\"IEEEAddr\":\"0x90FD9FFFFE03B051\"}} ZbSend Command structure: {\"Device\":\"<shortaddr>\", \"Endpoint\":\"<endpoint>\", \"Manuf\":<manuf>, \"Send\":{\"<sendcmd>\":<sendparam>}} <shortaddr> = short address of the Zigbee device on the network <endpoint> = target endpoint on the device ( understanding endpoints ) <manuf> = (optional) forces a specific ManufacturerId in the ZCL frame (required by some Xiaomi devices) \"<sendcmd>\":<sendparam> = command and parameters to send ( Zigbee Device Commands ) _Use ZbZNPSend to send a raw form low-level message on CC253x gateways _ Example: ZbSend { \"Device\":\"0x1234\", \"Endpoint\":\"0x03\", \"Send\":{\"Power\":\"on\"} } ZbStatus<x> Display Zigbee devices seen on the network since boot <device> (optional) = all devices This command provides three levels of increasing detail according to <x> ZbStatus1 Display Short Address, and Friendly Name ZbStatus2 Also include Manufacturer ID and Model ID ZbStatus3 Also include a list of endpoints and the clusterIds supported by each endpoint Example: ZbStatus3 1 requests all details for device number 1 Requested information may exceed maximum result size allowed by Tasmota. In this case, the output will be truncated. To get all of the desired information, request results for a specific device individually. ZbUnbind Unbinds one Zigbee device from another or from a group. {\"Device\":\"<device>\", \"Endpoint\":<endpoint>, \"Cluster\":<cluster>, \"ToDevice\":\"<to_device>\", \"ToEndpoint\":<to_endpoint>, \"ToGroup\":<to_group> } <device> = the device sending the messages (mandatory) <endpoint> = the source endpoint (mandatory) <cluster> = the source cluster id (mandatory) <to_device> = the target device (optional) <to_endpoint> = the target endpoint (optional if it can be inferred from ZbStatus3 ) <to_group> = the target group id (optional) You must specify either \"ToDevice\" or \"ToGroup\" but not both Zigbee2Tasmota must know the IEEE address of the target device, use ZbStatus2 to verify and ZbProbe to query the address. See also SetOption83 , SetOption89 , SetOption100 , SetOption101 Zigbee Debug Functions Do not use unless you know exactly what you are doing.

Counter is increased with every falling edge when CounterType =0 or time between successive falling edges is measured when CounterType =1. When CounterDebounceLow and CounterDebounceHigh are set to zero (default) only falling edges of the counter's GPIO are checked. Any CounterDebounceLow or CounterDebounceHigh unequal zero checks are carried out befor CounterDebounce check is done.

For CounterDebounceLow any GPIO change from low to high hat happens after the GPIO was not low for at least CounterDebounceLow will be ignored. As an example you can set CounterDebounceLow 50 to allow a valid minimum distance between a falling and rising edge equal to 50ms while having a final CounterDebounce 500 check between to succesive valid falling edges equal to 500ms.

Hardware Serial Bridge uses GPIO1 (Tx) and GPIO3 (Rx) or GPIO13 (Tx) and GPIO15 (Rx) pins of your device. Software Serial Bridge can use any other GPIO to be configured as components Serial Tx and Serial Rx (or SerBr Tx and SerBr Rx ). If Tx and Rx components are not assigned in the Template or Module, GPIO1 and GPIO3 will be used. Note that changing serial logging ( SerialLog 0) will disable the hardware Serial Bridge. Information received by Tasmota over the serial bridge is captured automatically. Before data will be received, a properly formatted SerialSend<x> or SSerialSend<x> command must be executed. This must be done any time the device restarts (e.g., via a System#Boot triggered rule). This command is required in order to set how the expected serial data will be formatted and interpreted (i.e., which <x> option). A {\"SSerialReceived\":{\"Data\":\"<string>\"}} message will be posted. You can use a rule to process the string which will be contained in SSerialReceived#Data .

Only when previously set with ZbName ZbBind Binds one Zigbee device to another device or to a group. This allows one device to directly send commands (f.e. a remote to a bulb) without any action on the coordinator. Command structure: {\"Device\":\"<device>\", \"Endpoint\":<endpoint>, \"Cluster\":<cluster>, \"ToDevice\":\"<to_device>\", \"ToEndpoint\":<to_endpoint>, \"ToGroup\":<to_group> } <device> = device sending messages (mandatory) <endpoint> = source endpoint (mandatory) <cluster> = source cluster id (mandatory) <to_device> = target device (optional) <to_endpoint> = target endpoint \u2003(optional if it can be inferred from ZbStatus3 ) <to_group> = target group id (optional) You must specify either \"ToDevice\" or \"ToGroup\" but not both Zigbee2Tasmota must know the IEEE address of target device, see ZbStatus2 to verify and ZbProbe to have Zigbee2Tasmota query the address ZbBindState<n> Asks the device for its internal binding states <device> the device to query <n> the start index for the request, 1 is the default. This is used to scan through all bindings. ZbConfig display the current Zigbee configuration Example or result: {\"ZbConfig\":{\"Channel\":11,\"PanID\":\"0x1A63\",\"ExtPanID\":\"0xCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC\",\"KeyL\":\"0x0F0D0B0907050301\",\"KeyH\":\"0x0D0C0A0806040200\"}} ZbConfig <json> change the configuration and restart if any change was applied. Warning: change in configuration causes a reset of the CC2530/ZBBridge and requires devices to be re-paired. \"Channel\":<channel> : Zigbee radio channel (11-26) \"PanID\":<panid> : identifier of the Zigbee Network \"ExtPanID\":<extpanid> : unique identifier of the Zigbee Network (ExtPanID features are not supported in Z2T but this parameter needs to be set) \"KeyL\":<key_l>,\"KeyH\":<key_h> : 128 bits encryption key, split into 2 64 bits values (Low and High) \"TXRadio\":<txradio> : radion power in dBm (1-20) only for ZBBridge All parameters are optional and only the ones specified are changed.

It does not un-pair the device nor deleting the device information in the CC2530/ZBBridge. ZbLight Sets or reads the light type to be emulated in Zigbee Hue Emulation with Alexa. <device>,<light_type> sets the light type using an integer 0..5 corresponding to the number of channels (from one channel (on/off) to 5 channel (RGBCCT) lights) <device>,-1 removes the device from Philips Hue emulation <device> displays the current status of the Light (Zigbee2Tasmota tracks all changes to the light) ZbListen<x> <group> (EZSP ZBBridge only)Listens to a multicast group address. By default EZSP will not report group messages unless you subscribe to the group. <x> : slot in the array of group addresses, 1..15 <group> : group address to listen to, 0..0xFFFF At start-up, Z2T automatically listns to groupe 0 in slot 0. CC2530 does not need this command and always report all group messages. ZbMap<n> Asks the device for its view of the Zigbee topology <device> the device to query <n> the start index for the request, 1 is the default. This is used to scan through all values since devices usually return only 3 values per request. ZbName Sets or reads the Zigbee device friendly name (up to 32 characters). <device>,<name> sets the new friendly name <device>, (empty name) clears the friendly name <device> displays the current friendly name Also see SetOption83 1 to enable friendly names as JSON keys instead of ShortAddr.

ZbPermitJoin Sets pairing mode for new device discovery 0 = disable pairing mode 1 = enable pairing mode for 60 seconds 99 = enable pairing until device reboots (CC2530 only) Leaving Zigbee network open to join will allow any Zigbee device to connect and retrieve your network encryption key. This can lead to a compromise of your Zigbee network. ZbPing <device> = test availability of Zigbee device. If the device is connected and not sleeping, you should receive a ZbPing message within the next second. Example: ZbPing 0x5ADF responds with: {\"ZbPing\":{\"Device\":\"0x5ADF\",\"IEEEAddr\":\"0x90FD9FFFFE03B051\"}} ZbSend Command structure: {\"Device\":\"<shortaddr>\", \"Endpoint\":\"<endpoint>\", \"Manuf\":<manuf>, \"Send\":{\"<sendcmd>\":<sendparam>}} <shortaddr> = short address of the Zigbee device on the network <endpoint> = target endpoint on the device ( understanding endpoints ) <manuf> = (optional) forces a specific ManufacturerId in the ZCL frame (required by some Xiaomi devices) \"<sendcmd>\":<sendparam> = command and parameters to send ( Zigbee Device Commands ) _Use ZbZNPSend to send a raw form low-level message on CC253x gateways _ Example: ZbSend { \"Device\":\"0x1234\", \"Endpoint\":\"0x03\", \"Send\":{\"Power\":\"on\"} } ZbStatus<x> Display Zigbee devices seen on the network since boot <device> (optional) = all devices This command provides three levels of increasing detail according to <x> ZbStatus1 Display Short Address, and Friendly Name ZbStatus2 Also include Manufacturer ID and Model ID ZbStatus3 Also include a list of endpoints and the clusterIds supported by each endpoint Example: ZbStatus3 1 requests all details for device number 1 Requested information may exceed maximum result size allowed by Tasmota. In this case, the output will be truncated. To get all of the desired information, request results for a specific device individually. ZbUnbind Unbinds one Zigbee device from another or from a group. {\"Device\":\"<device>\", \"Endpoint\":<endpoint>, \"Cluster\":<cluster>, \"ToDevice\":\"<to_device>\", \"ToEndpoint\":<to_endpoint>, \"ToGroup\":<to_group> } <device> = the device sending the messages (mandatory) <endpoint> = the source endpoint (mandatory) <cluster> = the source cluster id (mandatory) <to_device> = the target device (optional) <to_endpoint> = the target endpoint (optional if it can be inferred from ZbStatus3 ) <to_group> = the target group id (optional) You must specify either \"ToDevice\" or \"ToGroup\" but not both Zigbee2Tasmota must know the IEEE address of the target device, use ZbStatus2 to verify and ZbProbe to query the address.

Otherwise, follow this procedure for configuring the ESP chip pins used by your device. Some smart devices have additional functionality which may be handled by codes sent to a separate MCU in the device. Devices with functions offloaded to a separate MCU require additional coding in the software or via rules. Certain supported Tasmota BASE devices have built-in code to handle MCU controlled devices. Using a template with an appropriate BASE device may have the programming logic required to manage the MCU commands for your device. If an existing BASE device with the logic for your device is not available, a modified device driver will be required. This case is outside of the scope of this article. If your device is similar to the existing built-in module (e.g., a particular MCU or power monitoring algorithm) it is best to use that as a starting point. When you are not sure which module is suitable for your device, use Generic module (18) . Step 1. ~ Begin this procedure by disabling power state saves. Some improper GPIO assignments can cause device reboots. Disabling this setting avoids repeated flash writes. Also, it is best to allow Tasmota to return to a fail safe state in case of a bad configuration. Ensure that boot loop control is not disabled. Backlog SetOption0 0 ; SetOption36 1 Step 2. ~ Assign every available GPIO to successive Relay<x> components. For the initial GPIO probe, exclude \"dedicated\" GPIO such as GPIO0/GPIO2 and Tx/Rx, etc. You can use a Template to easily perform these assignments: { \"NAME\" : \"ID Relays\" , \"GPIO\" :[ 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 21 , 22 , 0 , 0 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ], \"FLAG\" : 0 , \"BASE\" : 18 } Step 2a. Save the configuration. Once the device reboots, use the virtual buttons on the web UI to find which of the assigned GPIO actually control the physical relays and LEDs on the device. Make note of which GPIO act on which device peripheral. If you are unable to control some of the relays or LEDs on the device, they may be attached to the \"dedicated\" GPIO skipped in the initial probe. Now assign those GPIOs and repeat step 2a : { \"NAME\" : \"ID Relays 2\" , \"GPIO\" :[ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ], \"FLAG\" : 0 , \"BASE\" : 18 } If your device is based on the ESP8285 and you are still unable to control some of the relays or LEDs on the device, they may be attached to GPIO9 or GPIO10. Now assign those remaining GPIO and repeat step 2a : { \"NAME\" : \"ID Relays 3\" , \"GPIO\" :[ 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 21 , 22 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ], \"FLAG\" : 0 , \"BASE\" : 18 } Step 2b. Once you have found which GPIOs control the relays and LEDs, set these \"active\" GPIO to associate them with the corresponding Relay<x> , LED<x> , or LEDLink or PWM<x> (Some may require the use of inverted (i.e., Relay<x>i / LED<x>i / LEDLinki ) component). Bulbs have mainly PWM . For proper operation, in the final device configuration, assignment of like components must begin from 1 and be assigned sequentially! Regular and inverted components can be intermixed. (e.g., Relay1 , then Relay2 ; Led1 , then Led2i and so on) Step 3. ~ Now assign every remaining GPIO (excluding, once again, remaining \"dedicated\" GPIO like GPIO0/GPIO2 and Tx/Rx, etc.) to successive Switch1 .. Switch8 components ( 9 .. 16 ). You can once again use a Template using 0 for the GPIO identified in step 2. Step 3a. Save the configuration. Once the device reboots, use the web UI Console to run the Status 8 (sensors) command. This will display the current state of each GPIO. Step 3b. Then, while either holding down the physical button or having flipped the position of the physical switch, display Status 8 again. Whichever GPIO changes state from what was shown in step 3a is the GPIO connected to the input. If you have a bulb, GPIO which are in state on will probably be SM16716 CLK or SM16716 DAT component. If none of the GPIO change state, then assign the remaining GPIO and retry step 3a . Step 3c. Once you have found which GPIO are connected to each input, change the GPIO setting in the configuration to a Button<x> or Switch<x> according to your input component or use case. Proper operation may dictate the use regular or inverted (i.e., Switch<x>i / Button<x>i ) settings. For buttons, you may need to determine whether the internal pull-up is used or not. If so, select Button<x> n , where n indicates no pull-up. Step 4. ~ Once you have determined which GPIO your device uses, set any remaining GPIOs to None (0) including the Analog A0 pin. Save the configuration. Step 5. ~ In case your device is a Tuya device with an MCU which controls everything see TuyaMCU for instructions on how to configure it. Step 6. ~ Once the device reboots, set the device to save power state changes ( SetOption0 1 ). Step 7. ~ Your device is configured for use with Tasmota. Submit new template ~ Since you have now configured a device not previously known to the Tasmota user base, you can export the template and submit it to the Tasmota Device Templates Repository .

GPIO0 and GPIO2 are the pins D3 and D4 on the Wemos D1 mini. D3 and D4 should only be used to connect push buttons (which are only low when pressed), not toggle switches. I have a cabin that is remote from my house, and I'm using a Sonoff to turn on/off the heaters remotely, so the place can be warm when I get there. The Sonoff(heater control) is located near the fuse box, and it controls a relay which switches the 120V/30A to the heaters. It's awkward to get at the Sonoff(heater control) to physically press the toggle button, so when I'm using it, I use MQTT commands to control the heaters. But I have some family members that are not comfortable with MQTT usage and certainly don't want to open the fuse box. So I built a small ESP-01 and a DHT22 and a push button, and used this project code to drive it (>rev 1.0.30). I use the cmnd/my_DHT/buttontopic to set the mqtt command to control the heaters. Yes, you can program a sonoff so that the button sends out any arbitrary command. In this case, I'm using the button to control the other sonoff. This ESP+DHT device is in the common area of the cabin, so my family members can simply push the button to toggle the heater. In other words, I'm using one trivial (DHT+button) wifi device to control the other (sonoff+heater relay). This technique uses Theo's flexible design, since buttontopic can be made different from topic . Schematic ~ NOTE: with this schematic, the DHT sensor is on GPIO2. You'll have to change the #define DHT_PIN in this project's source code from 14 to 2. Also, make sure you use the black ESP01 with 1MB of flash; most 2016 purchases should be ok. Of course you can use an ESP12 if you wish. The optional block shown attaches an LED to the DHT data line, so you can watch when the data is being fetched from the DHT device. Power regulator, 5V to 3.3V: search eBay for 5v/3.3v power 1117 ESP: search eBay for esp-01 and pick a black one DHT22: search eBay for dht22 ; any AM2302, DHT11 or DHT12 will do in its place; or you can omit the DHT and just use the button Cost (2016-09-05) USB-5V-adapter: CAD$1 + DC5V->3.3V: CAD$1 + ESP01: CAD$2.62 + DHT12: CAD$1.50 = CAD$6.12 = EUR 4.25 This little device has two inputs (DHT & button), and no output . You can use either the Sonoff or the ElectroDragon version of this project, but because this has no output, the following commands don't make any sense: power, light, ledstate . You may also want to change the #define APP_NAME and #define PROJECT to reflect that this isn't a real Sonoff. Pat B Update ~ 2017-11-12 This design still works with version 5.5.2 of the firmware. There's no need anymore to create a special build; the new design allows you to customize the code at runtime. For the above schematic, go into the Config Module menu and set - Module: 18 WeMos D1 mini - GPIO0: 09 Switch1 - GPIO2: 03 DHT22 and set switchtopic1 to the topic for the device you want to control, and switchmode1 to 3 (toggle). That's all you need to do :) I also discovered that the button must be a momentary pushbutton; don't use a switch, because both GPIO0 and GPIO2 must be floating at boot time. Another Update ~ 2017-09-22 I have installed the above device at my cabin in the woods, and I'm using a cellular modem to connect to the internet for data. If I set the Tasmota-Sonoff software with a teleperiod=3600 (once per hour), the MQTT traffic is about 6kB/hour, which is about 4.2MB/month. That includes the TCP keep-alives and the telemetry messages. So two devices (the main sonoff power switch and the esp-01 button device) takes 8.4MB/month, just below my economy 10MB/month sim card. Just FYI, I also have tried using a Raspberry PI at the cabin, and instructing it to SSH to my public-facing server, and creating a reverse tunnel back so that I can access my cabin from my public-facing server. The keep-alives on that connection is about 7.6MB/month. [The cellular phone company is probably using NAT, so I have to connect from cabin->server and not the other way around]","title":"Control a Sonoff using a remote button"},{"location":"Control-a-Sonoff-using-a-remote-button/#remote-button","text":"IMPORTANT: The ESP8266 needs GPIO0 and GPIO2 to be high (not connected to anything, or connected to 3.3V) during boot.

In fact, all its features are accessible from the command line, and the IDE is a convenience wrapper layer around it. Thus, we can build Tasmota using only this PlatformIO-Core, which may come handy for automated builds, or for those who feel more comfortable with the command line than with the IDE. The steps are surprisingly simple and straightforward: Provision a Linux VM ~ At least if you want to work in a cloud environment, but you may also choose to work on your physical machine as well. PlatformIO is based on python, so if we use python-virtualenv , then all the dependent packages will be confined to a separate folder, so it won't even taint the OS installation. As all of python , python-virtualenv and python-pip are available in most of the recent distros, you may pick your favourite one. Install python and tools ~ Install python and python-virtualenv , and python-pip , because we don't want to mess up the python ecosystem of the distro. Update pip by pip install --upgrade pip , and this was the last step done as root, the rest goes as a plain user.

In tasmota/user_config_override.h fine tune the default values for the module, the wifi, the MQTT server, and so on. Refer to the Tasmota Wiki for details. Build the firmware ~ The build command itself is pio run , but as it emits quite a lot of messages (including errors if you're developing), so you may want to redirect a copy of the standard output and error to a file, so it'll be pio run 2>&1 | tee build.log .

When you've changed only a few files, not everything needs to be recompiled (though the image must still be re-packed), so that minute-like build time is the maximum, usually it'll be less. Prepare the local installer tool ~ You may rebuild the firmware on a remote machine, but you must have the installer tool on the local machine where the module is connected to. Fortunately, it's also python-based, so we can again employ virtualenv here. If you built the firmware also on your localhost, then there is no need for a separate environment, you may quite well install esptool into that one. Otherwise, create a virtual environment the usual way: [ tasmota_installer @ lantash ~ ] $ virtualenv esptool New python executable in / home / tasmota_installer / esptool / bin / python2 . 7 Also creating executable in / home / tasmota_installer / esptool / bin / python Installing setuptools , pip , wheel ... done .

For the location see [[GPIO-Locations]]. I decided to use regular 2.54mm connectors (often referred to as Dupont connectors), so that I can switch sensors if I have to. In order to fit the dupont cables within the enclosure, I had to bend the 2.54mm pin headers by about 45\u00b0. As the DHT11 requires a pullup (depending on the cable length), and I didn't want to design a PCB just to connect 3 wires and a resistor, I came up with the solution described below. First, I slipped ferrules over the DHT11 pins and inserted the wires. This makes it a lot easier to hold the cables and the DHT11 pins in place. I left a bit more wire exposed so that I have a place to apply solder without burning the wire insulation. I applied heat to the ferrule, not the wire, and applied solder directly at the end of the ferrule. Solder will then flow into the ferrule. I also added a small solder blob (visible on the top ferrule) so that I can solder an 0805 resistor in place. Thanks to the ferrule, the wires won't become detached when heated again.

The ESP8266 has a limitation of a maximum of ~71 minutes deep sleep. To overcome the limitation, a short wake-up is performed - the device will wake up every hour for <0.3 seconds until the deep sleep time is reached. The remaining deep sleep time is decremented, and the device is then put back in deep sleep again. The remaining time is stored in RTC memory. As long as the device is powered (e.g., via the battery), this should work fine. Flash memory is not used because of how often this has to occur (every hour) and the time it takes for the flash to be ready takes much longer than the total time to write to the RTC. DeepSleepTime sets the time the device remains in deep sleep before it returns to full operating mode. Once the command is issued, the deep sleep cycle commences. During deep sleep, the device is effectively off and, as such, it is not possible to modify DeepSleepTime without exiting deep sleep. Example With DeepSleepTime 3600 , the device will wake up exactly every hour (e.g., 8:00am, 9:00am, ...). If you define DeepSleepTime 86400 (i.e., 60*60*24), it will wake-up exactly at 0:00 UTC time - not your local time. If you define DeepSleepTime 600 , it will wake-up every 10 minutes (e.g., 8:00, 8:10, 8:20, ...). Please be aware that the minimum deep sleep time is 10 seconds. In order for the device to wake itself to perform its function during the deep sleep cycle, the RST pin must be connected to the D0/GPIO16 pin. This is the only pin which can perform this function as the wake-up signal is sent from the RTC through D0/GPIO16 to RST. When connected to RST for our purposes, GPIO16 may not be used for other functions. As such, it is recommended to leave it configured as None (0) . Disable deep sleep mode ~ using a switch ~ Select another GPIO (let's call it \"GPIOn\") and connect it GND. This can be performed through a switch per the schematic below. Flipping the switch to \"ON\" will prevent Tasmota to enter DeepSleep again after next wake-up until the switch is flipped back OFF. GPIOn should be defined as DeepSleep (182) in the configuration as shown below: The following GPIOs CANNOT be used for the purpose of temporarily disabling deep sleep as described above: - GPIO16 (because it is connected to RST), - GPIO15 (because of an existing on-board pull-down resistor), - GPIO0 (because pulling it down at wake up will enter serial bootload mode). All others GPIO should be acceptable. An interresting use-case is to disable DeepSleep when external power (USB, PSU, solar panel...) is applied to the device using a transistor. If the device is not (easily) accessible, methods can be used to disable the DeepSleep loop without physical access. using MQTT ~ Send a retained DeepSleepTime 0 command to your device. As the message is retained in the MQTT broker, the device will receive it as soon as it connectes to the MQTT broker. You can use console to send from another Tasmota device: Publish2 cmnd/%topic%/DeepSleepTime 0 Don't forget to remove the retained message from the broker with Publish2 cmnd/%topic%/DeepSleepTime !!! If using mosquitto broker\" mosquitto_pub -t \"cmnd/myDeviceTopic/DeepsleepTime\" -r -m \"0\" Remove retained message mosquitto_pub -t \"cmnd/myDeviceTopic/DeepsleepTime\" -r -n Once you have made your configuration change, you will need to re-enable DeepSleep mode using DeepSleepTime command. using smart home automation ~ Configure a settable flag in your home automation hub (e.g., Node-Red, openHAB, Home Assistant). The flag should subscribe to the tele/%topic%/LWT topic for the payload Online . Alternatively, if testing the payload value is not easy, subscribe to the topic tele/%topic%/STATE which is the 2nd topic on which hte device publish right after waking-up. The moment a message is received on this topic, the automation can publish a message to topic cmnd/%topic%/DeepSleepTime with payload 0 . This will cause the device to disable deep sleep and allow maintenance such as firmware updates to be performed without having an unexpected deep sleep event. Send the DeepSleepTime 0 command only once . Once device maintenance is completed, place it back into deep sleep mode using original configuration. If you're having issues after wakeup from sleep Make sure bootloop detection is off SetOption36 0 . See issue #6890 Executing commands before entering DeepSleep ~ If you want to execute some commands or a special script BEFORE device goes into deep sleep, use FUNC_SAVE_BEFORE_RESTART as a predefined hook to implement your own procedure. This requires you to code your own function and self-compile custom firmware. To use rules, use the System#Save trigger. This will be executed just before the device goes into deep sleep. Overcome network issues ~ If all requirements (Wifi, NTP time synchronization, MQTT broker connection and TelePeriod) are not met, the device will stay awake while trying to attain the remaining requirements. On battery powered devices this behavior is undesirable because it will quickly deplete the battery. To avoid this when these requirements cannot be met, put the device back into deep sleep for an hour. Do this through a rule that will be triggered 30 seconds after reboot and sends the device into deepsleep for an hour. Rule1 ON Dimmer#Boot DO RuleTimer1 30 ENDON ON Rules#Timer=1 DO DeepSleepTime 3600 ENDON Rule1 ON Deep Sleep Algorithm General Timing ~ Let's assume you have set DeepSleepTime 3600 (one hour) and TelePeriod 300 (five minutes). The device will first wake at 8:00 am. The device will boot and connect Wi-Fi. Next, the correct time must be sync'ed from one of the NTP servers. Now the device has all prerequisites for going into deep sleep. Deep sleep is then triggered at the TelePeriod event. In this example, it will occur after five minutes. Telemetry will be collected and sent (e.g., via MQTT). Now, deep sleep can happen. First, Offline is published to the LWT topic on MQTT. It then calculates the new sleeping time to wake-up at 9:00 am (3600 seconds after the last wake-up). At 9:00 am this same sequence of events happens again. If you want to minimize the time that the device is in operation, decrease TelePeriod down to 10 seconds. This period of time is counted after MQTT is connected. Also, in this case, the device will wake up at 9:00 am even if the uptime was much smaller. If the device missed a wake-up it will try a start at the next event - in this case 10:00 am. ESP8266 Deep Sleep Side-effects ~ Not all GPIO behave the same during deep sleep. Some GPIO go HIGH, some LOW, some FOLLOW the relay but work only on FET transistors.

For example, with multiple lights in a device group, light settings can be changed on one light and the settings will automatically be changed on other lights. Dimmer switches could be in a device group with lights and that dimmer switch could control the power, brightness and colors of all the lights in the group. Multiple dimmer switches could be in a device group to form a 3-way/4-way dimmer switch. UDP multicasts, followed by UDP unicasts if necessary, are used to send updates to all devices so updates are fast. There is no need for an MQTT server but all the devices in a group must be on the same multicast network. The multicast address and port are specified at compile time with the DEVICE_GROUPS_ADDRESS (default = 239.255.250.250) and DEVICE_GROUPS_PORT (default = 4447) macros respectively. To enable device groups, execute command: SetOption85 1 . All devices in a group must be running firmware with device group support and have device groups enabled. Operation ~ The device group name is set with the DevGroupName command ( GroupTopic prior to v8.2.0.3). If a device group name is not set for a group, the MQTT group topic is used (with the device group number appended for device group numbers > 1). All devices in the same multicast network with the same device group name are in the same group. Some modules may define additional device groups. For example, if Remote Device Mode is enabled, the PWM Dimmer module defines three devices groups. The items sent and received from the group are selected with the DevGroupShare command. By default all items are sent and received. An example of when the DevGroupShare command would be used is when you have a group of lights that you control with a dimmer switch and home automation software. You want the dimmer switch to be able to control all items. The home automation software controls each light individually. When it controls the whole group, it actually sends command to each light in the group. If you use the home automation software to turn an individual light on or off or change it's brightness, color or scheme, you do not want the change to be replicated to the other lights. In this case, you would set the incoming and outgoing item masks to 0xffffffff (all items) on the dimmer switch ( DevGroupShare 0xffffffff,0xffffffff ) and set the incoming item mask to 0xffffffff and outgoing item mask to 0 on all the lights ( DevGroupShare 0xffffffff,0 ). By default, the state of all relays is sent to and received from device group 1. To enable each relay to be in a separate device group, enable option 88 ( SetOption88 1 ). Relay 1 updates will be sent to/received from device group 1, relay 2 updates will be sent to/received from device group 2, etc. Troubleshooting ~ If no values seem to be shared between devices, perform the following checks: Enter the command SetOption85 on all devices in the group and make sure the result is ON on all devices. Enter the command DevGroupName on all devices in the group and make sure the result for device group 1 is the exact same (case-sensitive) name on all devices. Enter the command DevGroupShare -1,-1 on all devices in the group to enable sharing of all items. Enter the command DevGroupSend 128=1 on one device in the group. If the power turns on on the other devices, the device groups feature is working. Enter the command DevGroupStatus on all devices in the group. If you do not see all the other devices in the group listed as members, multicast packets are not being received by the devices. Check the network infrastructure that connects the devices together to make sure multicasts are enabled are not being filtered. Commands ~ Command Parameters DevGroupName<x> 0 = clear device group <x> name and restart <value> = set device group <x> name and restart. Prior to 8.2.0.3, GroupTopic was used to specify the device group name. DevGroupSend<x> <item> = <value>[ ...] = send an update to device group <x>. The device group name must have been previously set with DevGroupName<x>. Multiple item/value pairs can be specified separated by a space. Spaces in <value> must be escaped with a backslash (\\). The message sent is also processed on the local device as if it had been received from the network. For items with numeric values, <value> can be specified as @<operator>[<operand>] to send a value after performing an operation on the current value. <operator> can be + (add), - (subtract) or ^ (invert). If <operand> is not specified, it defaults to 0xffffffff for the invert operator and 1 for other operators. Examples: DevGroupSend 4=90 128=1 - send an update to set the light brightness to 90 and turn relay 1 on. DevGroupSend 193=Buzzer\\\\ 2,3 - send the Buzzer 2,3 command. DevGroupSend 6=@+ 4=@-10 - set the next fixed color and decrease the brightness by 10. DevGroupSend 128=^ - toggle all the relays. 2 = Light fade (0 = Off, 1 = On) 3 = Light speed (1..40) 4 = Light brightness (0..255) 5 = Light Scheme 6 = Light fixed color (0 = white (using CT channels), other values according to Color ) 7 = PWM dimmer low preset (0..255) 8 = PWM dimmer high preset (0..255) 9 = PWM dimmer power-on brightness (0..255) 128 = Relay Power - bitmask with bits set for relays to be powered on.

For example, with multiple lights in a device group, light settings can be changed on one light and the settings will automatically be changed on other lights. Dimmer switches could be in a device group with lights and that dimmer switch could control the power, brightness and colors of all the lights in the group. Multiple dimmer switches could be in a device group to form a 3-way/4-way dimmer switch. UDP multicasts, followed by UDP unicasts if necessary, are used to send updates to all devices so updates are fast. There is no need for an MQTT server but all the devices in a group must be on the same multicast network. The multicast address and port are specified at compile time with the DEVICE_GROUPS_ADDRESS (default = 239.255.250.250) and DEVICE_GROUPS_PORT (default = 4447) macros respectively.

If a device group name is not set for a group, the MQTT group topic is used (with the device group number appended for device group numbers > 1). All devices in the same multicast network with the same device group name are in the same group. Some modules may define additional device groups. For example, if Remote Device Mode is enabled, the PWM Dimmer module defines three devices groups. The items sent and received from the group are selected with the DevGroupShare command. By default all items are sent and received. An example of when the DevGroupShare command would be used is when you have a group of lights that you control with a dimmer switch and home automation software. You want the dimmer switch to be able to control all items. The home automation software controls each light individually. When it controls the whole group, it actually sends command to each light in the group. If you use the home automation software to turn an individual light on or off or change it's brightness, color or scheme, you do not want the change to be replicated to the other lights. In this case, you would set the incoming and outgoing item masks to 0xffffffff (all items) on the dimmer switch ( DevGroupShare 0xffffffff,0xffffffff ) and set the incoming item mask to 0xffffffff and outgoing item mask to 0 on all the lights ( DevGroupShare 0xffffffff,0 ). By default, the state of all relays is sent to and received from device group 1. To enable each relay to be in a separate device group, enable option 88 ( SetOption88 1 ).

While full update delivers a clean and sharp picture, it has the disadvantage of taking several seconds for the screen update and shows severe flickering during update. Partial update is quite fast (300 ms) with no flickering but there is the possibility that erased content is still slightly visible. It is therefore useful to perform a full update in regular intervals (e.g., each hour) to fully refresh the display. Compilation directives: #define USE_SPI , #define USE_DISPLAY , #define USE_DISPLAY_EPAPER29 , or #define USE_DISPLAY_EPAPER42 Remark : the 4.2 e-Paper display requires about 15k of RAM. Therefore it only works with Core 2.42 and above. OLED Lifetime The typical specifications for the lifetime of an OLED when permanently on is about 10000 hours (416 days). Dimming to 50% expands the lifetime to about 25000 hours. Burn-in The data sheets of the TFT and OLED displays mention burn-in effects when a static display is shown for extended periods of time. You may want to consider turning on the display on demand only. Fonts ~ The EPD font contains 95 characters starting from code 32, while the classic GFX font contains 256 characters ranging from 0 to 255. Custom characters above 127 can be displayed. To display these characters, you must specify an escape sequence (standard octal escapes do not work). The ~ character followed by a hex byte can define any character code. GFXFont: EPDFont: Hardware Connections ~ I 2 C displays are connected in the usual manner and defined via the GPIO component selection. The I 2 C address must be specified using DisplayAddress XX , e.g., 60 . The model must be spedified with DisplayModel , e.g., 2 for SSD1306. To permanently turn the display on set DisplayDimmer 100 . Display rotation can be permanently set using DisplayRotate X (x = 0..3 ). E-Paper displays are connected via software 3-wire SPI (CS, SCLK, MOSI) . The other three interface lines of the display (DC, Reset, busy) may be left unconnected. The jumper on the circuit board of the display must be set to 3-wire SPI. The ILI9488, ILI9341 and SSD1351 are connected via hardware 3-wire SPI (MOSI=GPIO13, SCLK=GPIO14, CS=GPIO15) . The ILI9488 must also be connected to the backlight pin (dimmer supported on SSD1351). Wiring The RA8876 is connected via standard hardware 4-wire SPI (MOSI=GPIO13, SCLK=GPIO14, CS=GPIO15, MISO=GPIO12) . No backlight pin is needed (dimmer supported). The ST7789 is connected via 4 Wire software SPI ((CS), SCLK, MOSI, DC, (RES), BL ) Examples ~ Print Text at size 1 on line 1, column 1: DisplayText [s1l1c1]Hello how are you?

The 2.9 inch driver is for partial update and should also support other Waveshare partial update models with modified WIDTH and HEIGHT parameters. The 4.2 inch driver is a hack which makes the full update display behave like a partial update and should probably work with other full update displays. The drivers are subclasses of the Adafruit GFX library. The class hierarchy is LOWLEVEL :: Paint :: Renderer :: GFX , where: GFX : unmodified Adafruit library Renderer : the interface for Tasmota Paint : the modified pixel driver for e-paper - there are several virtual functions that can be subclassed down to LOWLEVEL . The display dispatcher only does the class initialization call. All other calls go to the Renderer class. In black and white displays, a local RAM buffer must be allocated before calling the driver. This must be set to zero on character or TFT color displays. Remark : To use the 400x300 e-Paper display, the Arduino library 2.4 or later must be used because it leaves much more RAM available than prior versions. This display requires 15k of RAM! The EPD fonts use about 9k space, which can be selected at compile time using #ifdef directives.

Dynamic Sleep is enabled by default from Tasmota version 6.3.0.15 but may be reconfigured by setting the value of SetOption60 accordingly. Command Description SetOption60 0 Dynamic Sleep is ENABLED (Default since 6.3.0.15) SetOption60 1 Normal Sleep is ENABLED The term CPU is used loosely here for the sake of making it easier to understand - When the term CPU is used it is actually referring to the ESP8266 SoC Micro Controller. With the introduction of many new drivers, sensors and other functions as part of the Tasmota firmware, it has become more important to pay specific attention to the amount of microcontroller clock cycles shared with the underlying SDK/Arduino ESP8266 Core. The main application loop of the Tasmota firmware needs to visit each of the driver callbacks within the main loop to make sure all the required drivers and sensors receive the necessary processing time whilst ensuring that the main loop does not overwhelm the need for processing time by the SDK / Arduino ESP8266 core. The highest priority drivers/sensors need to be called once per 50ms to operate as designed but most of the normal run of the mill drivers and sensors do not necessarily require this amount of intense polling. The 50-millisecond mark would normally be considered to be an absolute minimum duty cycle for the main processing loop on ESP8266 boards whilst most Sonoff device derivatives will function perfectly well way above this default setting. To make this manageable from device to device a new setting has been introduced enabling the setting of the main loop target to a specific value in milliseconds. For default operation, this will be set to 50 milliseconds as there are generally no drivers or sensors that need to be polled at a rate higher than this. To allow for power usage flexibility this value may also be increased to a value of up to 250 milliseconds which is very useful to reduce power and processing demand on non-time critical devices such as switches (which is what most of Tasmota is used for.) The purpose of this setting is to allow you as a user to set the speed at which driver and sensors will be serviced and as a result also the amount of time given to the SDK / Arduino ESP8266 core to handle its background tasks (which are not under direct control of the Tasmota firmware.) Example Use Case ~ Let's assume the default value of 50 for sleep and that a simple device such as a Sonoff Basic R1 or R2 is being used. In this case, the main firmware loop will iterate through all the drivers and sensors once per 50 milliseconds. Current tests suggest that a simple device such as a Sonoff Basic requires only about 9.5 milliseconds to complete one iteration of servicing all the drivers and sensors enabled in the standard tasmota.bin firmware. The time management functionality offered by dynamic sleep will compute this time requirement automatically and allow the SDK / Arduino ESP8266 Core to service background tasks such as maintaining WiFi connectivity for the remainder of the time not spent in the main firmware loop - i.e. in the case of sleep 50 this would mean 50 milliseconds - ~9.5 milliseconds = ~40.5 milliseconds spent outside of the main firmware loop servicing SDK / ESP8266 Core functions which automatically consume fewer clock cycles when there is nothing intense for the SDK / ESP8266 Core to maintain or perform. Normal Sleep was previously the only option for Tasmota powered devices wishing to take advantage of power saving but it does have the disadvantage that the sleep would be a constant setting insofar that the entire firmware codebase would run at a pre-determined speed causing some drivers to run slower than expected and decreasing the speed at which services such as the WebUI is rendered (This varies between the various underlying cores depending on which version is used.) Using Dynamic Sleep (SetOption60 = 0) instead of Normal Sleep (SetOption60 = 1) has the advantage that CPU time will be given to any particular driver or process (let's say the WebUI) on demand as and when needed whilst spending most of its time waiting for the next main loop iteration to occur. During this time of waiting the ESP8266's power demand can go from 80mA all the way down to 20mA which yields great benefits for power saving vs. firmware responsiveness compared to the traditional sleep setting. Normally the target main loop setting would be 50 milliseconds. The firmware will service all the driver and sensor callbacks up to a maximum of 20 times per second. In most cases, this is unnecessary as most normal sensors like temperature sensors only need polling once per second. So, whether you poll the temperature sensor 20 times per second (sleep 50) or 5 times per second (sleep 200) it has no impact on the functionality. Allowing the main loop to iterate 20 times per second vs. 5 times per second is obviously more time consuming and processor consuming leaving less time to idle (i.e., save power). For example, if you were using an MCP230xx with interrupts, and you need a high interrupt response then sleep 50 or lower would make sense since that specific driver can poll once per 50 milliseconds to check for interrupts. Most other sensor polling can be done in intervals longer than 50 milliseconds so you achieve more idle time, and therefore also more sleep time so it saves power. Monitoring Performance ~ Given all the above it is an obvious conclusion that in order to manage something you would need to be able to measure it. For this reason two new variables have been added to the telemetry data namely LoopSet and LoadAvg and are represented in the telemetry JSON as follows: MQT : tele /sound1/ STATE = { \"Time\" : \"2018-11-26T17:41:27\" , \"Uptime\" : \"0T05:05:17\" , \"Vcc\" : 3.504 , \"SleepMode\" : \"Dynamic\" , \"Sleep\" : 50 , \"LoadAvg\" : 19 , \"POWER\" : \"OFF\" , \"Wifi\" :{ \"AP\" : 1 , \"SSId\" : \"Wireless\" , \"BSSId\" : \"DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF\" , \"Channel\" : 3 , \"RSSI\" : 100 }} The two values indicated for LoopSet and LoadAvg have the following relation: Variable Value Description SleepMode Normal Normal Sleep mode is enabled (SetOption60 = 1) SleepMode Dynamic Dynamic Sleep mode is enabled (SetOption60 = 0) Sleep 50 Current setting for sleep LoadAvg 19 Reported % time of Sleep spent doing Tasmota main loop processing In this example, 19% of 50 milliseconds would be 9.5 milliseconds (19/100*50), so we can see that there is sufficient headroom for the SDK / ESP8266 Arduino Core to do its background work. On some devices which have many sensors connected you may observe the LoadAvg value exceeding 100 - This means that you have not set the value of sleep high enough to accommodate all the sensors and drivers which need to be serviced. In the latter case, you have two options - either increase the value of sleep to a higher one to maintain a load average well below 100 or use multiple devices to spread the load across separate Tasmota powered devices/boards. For the most part, all Sonoff based products should perform well balanced with the default setting of 50 for sleep. How to use Dynamic Sleep ~ From serial console, or webui console enter command SetOption60 0 and Sleep xx Where xx is the number of milliseconds you wish to target your main processing loop at ranging from 0 through to 250. Should you set a sleep value that is too low you will observe output on telemetry for the value of LoadAvg to be in excess of 100 - This is not ideal and should be avoided as it starves the Arduino Core / SDK of the needed processing time to take care of background tasks such as WiFi management. For optimal operation of the Tasmota firmware, it is recommended to keep your device running at a LoadAvg value of 75 or lower. If your device does not have any time critical drivers/sensors connected you are encouraged to increase the sleep value to a higher value to gain from the power saving benefits thereof.","title":"Dynamic Sleep"},{"location":"Dynamic-Sleep/#dynamic-sleep-cpu-main-loop-target-cpu-power-management","text":"SetOption60 may be used to configure your device to use Normal Sleep or Dynamic Sleep.

Most other sensor polling can be done in intervals longer than 50 milliseconds so you achieve more idle time, and therefore also more sleep time so it saves power.","title":"Example Use Case"},{"location":"Dynamic-Sleep/#monitoring-performance","text":"Given all the above it is an obvious conclusion that in order to manage something you would need to be able to measure it.

On some devices which have many sensors connected you may observe the LoadAvg value exceeding 100 - This means that you have not set the value of sleep high enough to accommodate all the sensors and drivers which need to be serviced. In the latter case, you have two options - either increase the value of sleep to a higher one to maintain a load average well below 100 or use multiple devices to spread the load across separate Tasmota powered devices/boards. For the most part, all Sonoff based products should perform well balanced with the default setting of 50 for sleep.","title":"Monitoring Performance"},{"location":"Dynamic-Sleep/#how-to-use-dynamic-sleep","text":"From serial console, or webui console enter command SetOption60 0 and Sleep xx Where xx is the number of milliseconds you wish to target your main processing loop at ranging from 0 through to 250. Should you set a sleep value that is too low you will observe output on telemetry for the value of LoadAvg to be in excess of 100 - This is not ideal and should be avoided as it starves the Arduino Core / SDK of the needed processing time to take care of background tasks such as WiFi management. For optimal operation of the Tasmota firmware, it is recommended to keep your device running at a LoadAvg value of 75 or lower. If your device does not have any time critical drivers/sensors connected you are encouraged to increase the sleep value to a higher value to gain from the power saving benefits thereof.","title":"How to use Dynamic Sleep"},{"location":"ESP32/","text":"ESP32 Support (Beta development) ~ ESP32 support is in beta and not all functions will work You can download precompiled development binaries from https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/tree/firmware/firmware/tasmota32 and the needed ESP32 flash files.

While sleeping your device will consume less power. Dynamic Sleep is enabled by default with a value of 50. To continue using Normal Sleep you may disable it by using the command: SetOption60 1 Setting Sleep to lowest value 1 reduces power consumption already about ~30% in idle mode (relay off) and button presses are still noticed without any delay. Setting this around 50 ms reduces power consumption from ~1.1 W to ~0.6 W on an idling (relay off) device and button presses are still noticed correctly. With this setting you have to concentrate very hard to click the button so fast that it is not recognized by the device. If your device needs to do something continuously, this will be affected. E.g., device LED will flicker and Sonoff POW will not be able to correctly total the energy consumption. Spot readings of power, voltage, etc. will however remain correct. From the release notes: Expect overall button/key/switch misses and wrong values on Sonoff Pow Notes: - Starting with Tasmota 6.1.1.12 Sleep \u2260 0 has no impact on real time related commands like Delay , PulseTime , TelePeriod and Blinktime . - As the WiFi Modem on an ESP8266 is the major consumer - using Sleep with WiFi AP mode enabled is more or less without effect. Device power consumption and measurement ~ Most low-price plug-in home energy meters like Sonoff devices are very imprecise for power consumption < 10 W and become more and more imprecise for power consumption (< 1.5 W). Furthermore, the results of such meters are very strongly dependant on the load type (capacitive/inductive) and are absolutely imprecise for non-ohmic load types having switch-mode power supplies. In addition, using Sleep - which periodically cycles the power of the device between 20% and 100% - on such meters makes their readings more or less useless. Example of power consumption ~ Absolute AC line measurement using calibrated meter ~ The following measurement was done directly on 230 V/AC line using a Sonoff Dual R2 and two different Sonoff S20 connected on different MID calibrated meter (Eastron SMD630 MID/saia-burgess ALE3). Device power consumption using Sleep Device Sleep 0 Sleep 1 Sleep 50 Sleep 200 Sonoff Dual R2 1.24 W 0.84 W 0.76 W 0.68 W Sonoff S20 1.11 W 0.77 W 0.59 W 0.51 W All measurements were done with - WiFi STA mode, enabled and connected (70%) - MQTT enabled and connected - Syslog enabled and connected - TelePeriod 60 for debugging - Relays off - Measurement period of 24-56 hours to reduce measurement discrepancies The first impression is that a higher sleep value reduces the consumption, but only slightly. The second result is that using Sleep <value> ( value \u2260 0, e. g., 1) is good enough to reduce the power consumption anywhere between 1/3 and up to 45% (value=200). Quantity measurement of ESP-12 module/ESP8266 3.3V line ~ To find out why Sleep reduces the power consumption and how its value should be set, the current of the 3.3V DC ESP8266 of an ESP-12 module was measured using an oscilloscope and (for easy reading the oscilloscope diagram) a 1 \u03a9 shunt which results in a 1:1 interpretation between voltage and current. This measurement simplified the measure of a time based power consumption; no integration must be done. On the other side note that the quantity measurement does not respect the effectiveness of the complete device circuit. Sleep 0 Using Sleep 0 there are no delay() calls in Tasmota main loop and therefore the power consumption is continuous at current ~80 mA: Sleep 1 Due to the fact that the Tasmota main loop now calls delay() (even with 1ms) it seems it results in periodically (100ms) enabling the WiFi Modem Sleep mode within the WiFi Manager library. It results in periodically lowering the current to 15-20 mA for ~90ms of each loop: Sleep 100 By increasing the sleep value, there are more and more ~90ms periods with additional lowering of the current to 8-10 mA - I really don't know where this comes from: Sleep 250 As already noticed with Sleep 100 the number periods having 8-10 mA instead of 15-20 mA increase again: The quantity measurement confirms the suspicion that a Sleep value \u2260 0 results in reducing the power consumption about 1/3.","title":"Energy Saving"},{"location":"Energy-Saving/#device-power-consumption-and-measurement","text":"Most low-price plug-in home energy meters like Sonoff devices are very imprecise for power consumption < 10 W and become more and more imprecise for power consumption (< 1.5 W).

The information below is for the Python version of esptool - If you want to use the Windows/Linux/OSX(MAC) executable version of esptool (as would be included in Arduino ESP8266 cores) then please go to the esptool executable (Windows & Linux) section at the bottom. Download Esptool ~ If you do not have an installed copy of Python 2.x or 3.x download and install it from https://www.python.org/. Download Esptool Source code from https://github.com/espressif/esptool/releases to a known folder. Install Esptool ~ Go to the known folder and install Esptool with command python setup.py install . Packages for Esptool are maintained for Debian and Ubuntu and can be installed with sudo apt install esptool . Download Tasmota ~ Download the latest Tasmota release firmware file tasmota.bin to a known folder. A second source is thehackbox This source can be used for OTA too. Upload Tasmota ~ Put device in firmware upload mode ~ When performing a firmware upload do not connect the device to AC but use the power supply provided by your (FTDI type) serial interface. Put the device in firmware upload mode by grounding pin GPIO00 while applying power. Grounding pin GPIO00 can often be achieved by pressing button 1 on the Sonoff device or using a wire between GPIO00 and Gnd if the button is not available. Deviations may apply. Connect the serial interface of your PC to the device while GPIO00 to Gnd. Esptool uses the serial interface to communicate with your device. On Windows these interfaces are named COM1, COM2 etc. On Linux these interfaces are called /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1 etc. Before using Esptool make sure you know to which serial interface name your device is connected to. In the following commands I use COM5 as an example. Optional: Backup firmware ~ Ensure the device is in firmware upload mode. Backup the current firmware with the following command: esptool . py -- port COM5 read_flash 0x00000 0x100000 image1M . bin NOTE: When the command completes the device is out of firmware upload mode! Erase firmware ~ Ensure the device is in firmware upload mode. Erase the complete flash memory holding the firmware with the following command: esptool . py -- port COM5 erase_flash NOTE1: When the command completes the device is out of firmware upload mode! NOTE2: It only takes a few seconds to erase 1M of flash. Upload firmware ~ Ensure the device is in firmware upload mode. Load the downloaded Tasmota firmware file tasmota.bin with the following command: esptool . py -- port COM5 write_flash - fs 1 MB - fm dout 0x0 tasmota . bin NOTE1: When the command completes the device is out of firmware upload mode! NOTE2: For a proper device initialization after first firmware upload power down and power up the device. ESPTOOL Executable (Windows & Linux) ~ The executable version of esptool is maintained by Ivan Grokhotkov and releases are kept at https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck/releases Download and Install ~ For the purpose of simplicity only the Windows version will be explained here, but the command and parameters are the same for Windows, Linux and MAC/OSX. Download the latest release from https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck/releases and extract the compressed file to a known location. Download Tasmota ~ Download the latest Tasmota release firmware file tasmota.bin to a known folder (The same folder as where you have the esptool executable will work well for this process to be simpler) If you want features from the current development codebase which has not been included in the last release please download this tasmota.bin to a known folder (The same folder as where you have the esptool executable will work well for this process to be simpler) The information posted further up in this Wiki for placing the device into bootload / firmware upgrade mode may be followed as this process does not change irrespective whether you use the Python or executable version of esptool. Once the device is in firmware upload mode the following commands are recommended for completion of the firmware flashing. Erase the flash completely with the following command (substituting the COM port for the one which was used on your computer) esptool -cp COM3 -cb 115200 -ce -v Once the erase is complete, reset your device back into programming mode and then upload the firmware using the following command esptool -cp COM3 -cb 115200 -bm dout -cf tasmota.bin -v","title":"Esptool"},{"location":"Esptool/#download-esptool","text":"If you do not have an installed copy of Python 2.x or 3.x download and install it from https://www.python.org/.

I ordered on Aliexpress some 2.5 mm jacks and when I received it after some work... The schematic reports that 2.5 mm jack is configured as following (jack on right side, ESP8285 on the left side: 3.3V and GND are very welcome for sensors expansions but GPIO7 and GPIO8 are not usable because they are used internally by ESP8285 for flash memory connection (sigh!) R35 and R36 resistors are not soldered on Sonoff 4CH PCB and it is possible to use their pads to \"manually route\" the jack contact on another ESP8285 pin (!). I selected R35 pad because my \"waterproof\" DS18B20 sensors provide signal line on TEM1 jack contact. For ESP8285 pin I prefer IO2 that is already available on header programming pins... Then the route to do is: TEM1 -> R35 pad -> GPIO2: DS18B20 sensors need a 4.7Kohm pullup resistor between DATA pin and 3.3V and this is also useful to pullup GPIO2 in order to avoid ESP8285 reset. Final result in these photos: Tasmota is also configured with DS18x20 on GPIO2 and it works ! * Note * : source file sonoff/sonoff_template.h provides the configuration on Sonoff 4CH and it is also possible to use GPIO16 (as in the screenshot above) but be aware that no interrupts can be used on GPIO16 and you could have problems with some sensors.","title":"Expanding 4CH"},{"location":"Expanding-Tasmota/","text":"You can wire peripherals (sensors, displays, switches, LED lights, ...) to available pins of the ESP8266 chip that controls these devices. To make a link between the different naming schemes the Pin Definition overview in the ESP8266 wiki is quite helpful. Examples ~ Connect switch If you take a Sonoff Basic and connect a switch between pin4 (GND) and pin5 (GPIO14) of the 5 pin programming header you now have a second switch connected to the device. You can set this through the module config page as option Switch1 (9) or from the command line with gpio14 9 . See Buttons and Switches for more information. Connect jack Instead of connecting a switch, you could connect a 4-pin 2.5mm jack, with the pins wired: Jack Pin ESP8266 tip 5 GPIO14 R1 no connection R2 1 GND R3 4 3.3V You can then plug a sensor into the jack like you would to a Sonoff TH and define what sensor you have connected to GPIO14. Danger If you can avoid it, don't use GPIOs: 0, 1, 2, 6-11, 15 and 16 . That leaves 4, 5, 12, 13, 14 as GPIOs without any constraints. 3 being RX is also good to avoid (PWM is not working on this GPIO). Others can be used but you have to mind the constraints outlined in this document . Danger The ESP8266 is a 3.3V microcontroller, so its I/O operates at 3.3V as well. The pins are not 5V tolerant, applying more than 3.6V on any pin will release the magic smoke (fry the chip). The maximum current that can be drawn from a single GPIO pin is 12mA. Danger The power supplied to the device is one of the most important elements for stable device operation. Many devices on the market have barely adequate power supplies for normal operation. Connected peripherals may strain the ability of the power supply on the device to deliver appropriate power to all the components, both on-board as well as externally connected. Voltage regulation issues typically result in fatal exception fault code 1 . You must ensure that the device receives sufficient power (current and appropriate voltage level). Take into account the current that each wired component (f.e. sensor) will draw from the device itself. Electrical Considerations ~ When you switch a GPIO pin to an input and hang a long wire off of it, that wire can pick up stray signals and cause the voltage on the GPIO pin to vary. This can cause the system to think the switch has changed. To fix this, there are several things you can do. add a pull-up resistor add a bypass capacitor shielding on the wire use twisted pair wiring A pull-up resistor is a resistor connected between the GPIO pin and 3.3v. The exact value of this is not critical, 4.7k is a common value to use, as is 10k. This ensures that when the switch it open, the GPIO pin will go high. A bypass capacitor is a small (pF range) capacitor that is connected between the GPIO and ground. This provides a path for any radio signals that are picked up by the wire to go to ground and not confuse the system. Shielding or using twisted pair wiring are other ways to reduce the effect of radio signals on the system. Example for 10K Resistor (issue #2708 ) The ESP8266 Hardware ~ Complete document available from https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap04%20-%20Microcontroller.html Digital I/O ~ Just like a normal Arduino, the ESP8266 has digital input/output pins (I/O or GPIO, General Purpose Input/Output pins). As the name implies, they can be used as digital inputs to read a digital voltage, or as digital outputs to output either 0V (sink current) or 3.3V (source current). Usable pins ~ The ESP8266 and ESP8255 have 17 GPIO pins (0-16) but several are reserved or have constraints . Do not use any of the reserved pins. If you do, you might crash your program. On the ESP8266, six pins (GPIO 6 - 11) are used to interface the flash memory (the small 8-legged chip usually right next to the ESP8266). The ESP8255 has its flash memory integrated into the chip which frees up GPIO 9 and 10. GPIO 1 and 3 are used as TX and RX of the hardware Serial port (UART), so in most cases, you can\u2019t use them as normal I/O while sending/receiving serial data. Boot modes ~ Some I/O pins have a special function during boot: They select 1 of 3 boot modes: GPIO15 GPIO0 GPIO2 Mode 0V 0V 3.3V Uart Bootloader 0V 3.3V 3.3V Boot sketch (SPI flash) 3.3V x x SDIO mode (not used for Arduino) Note: you don\u2019t have to add an external pull-up resistor to GPIO2, the internal one is enabled at boot. We have to be sure that these conditions are met by adding external resistors, or the board manufacturer of your board has added them for you. This has some implications, however: GPIO15 is always pulled low, so you can\u2019t use the internal pull-up resistor. You have to keep this in mind when using GPIO15 as an input to read a switch or connect it to a device with an open-collector (or open-drain) output, like I\u00b2C. GPIO0 is pulled high during normal operation, so you can\u2019t use it as a Hi-Z input. GPIO2 can\u2019t be low at boot, so you can\u2019t connect a switch to it. Internal pull-up/-down resistors GPIO 0-15 all have a built-in pull-up resistor, just like in an Arduino. GPIO16 has a built-in pull-down resistor. PWM ~ Unlike most Atmel chips (Arduino), the ESP8266 doesn\u2019t support hardware PWM, however, software PWM is supported on all digital pins. The default PWM range is 10-bits @ 1kHz, but this can be changed (up to >14-bit@1kHz). Check Restrictions . Analog input ~ The ESP8266 has a single analog input, with an input range of 0 - 1.0V. If you supply 3.3V, for example, you will damage the chip. Some boards like the NodeMCU have an on-board resistive voltage divider, to get an easier 0 - 3.3V range. You could also just use a trimpot as a voltage divider. The ADC (analog to digital converter) has a resolution of 10 bits. Communication ~ Serial ~ The ESP8266 has two hardware UARTS (Serial ports): UART0 on pins 1 and 3 (TX0 and RX0 resp.), and UART1 on pins 2 and 8 (TX1 and RX1 resp.), however, GPIO8 is used to connect the flash chip. This means that UART1 can only transmit data. UART0 also has hardware flow control on pins 15 and 13 (RTS0 and CTS0 resp.). These two pins can also be used as alternative TX0 and RX0 pins. I\u00b2C ~ ESP8266 doesn\u2019t have a hardware TWI (Two Wire Interface) but it is implemented in software. This means that you can use pretty much any two digital pins. By default, the I\u00b2C library uses pin 4 as SDA and pin 5 as SCL. (The data sheet specifies GPIO2 as SDA and GPIO14 as SCL.) The maximum speed is approximately 450kHz. SPI ~ The ESP8266 has one SPI connection available to the user, referred to as HSPI. It uses GPIO14 as CLK, 12 as MISO, 13 as MOSI and 15 as Slave Select (SS). It can be used in both Slave and Master mode (in software).

Remove them and try again. Other reason can be using an SSID longer than the allowed 32 characters. With some Wi-Fi routers (i.e. Linksys with DD-WRT), you may have conflicts with the 5GHz radio. Don't choose \"Mixed\" option. Select \"AC/N-Mixed\" instead. Moreover, you probably should disconnect 5GHz radio during the configuration process. DD-WRT also has Wi-Fi Multi-Media (WMM) enabled by default. Disabling WMM can resolve connectivity issues. I entered wrong Wi-Fi information ~ If you have a device with a button and the button is configured as a component in the Tasmota settings (e.g., GPIO0 - Button1), you can try pressing the button to force the device into Wi-Fi configuration mode with 4 short presses of the button. Note: Since version 8.3.0 this requires 6 short presses instead. If that didn't work reset your device using Fast power cycle device recovery If you are unsure what SSID you have entered, you can try to find that with special Wi-Fi sniffing tools. For example Nirsoft WifiChannelMonitor can show your mistakenly configured SSID name. Linux system example: apt install aircrack-ng wireshark airmon-ng check kill airmon-ng start (e.g. wlp58s0 or wlan0) wireshark Select your Wi-Fi device from the list. Plug in the mis-configured device and immediately watch SSIDs. You should see your mis-configured SSID fairly soon. If these methods don't work, it may still be possible to save the device without opening it to perform a serial flash. Since Tasmota uses GET request for forms, the password may be in your browser history. Search in your browser history for 192.168.4.1 (or whatever address you used for configuring it) There should be an entry similar to this: http://192.168.4.1/wi?s1=<mySSID>&p1=<myPassword>-********&s2=&p2=********&h=hostName&save= s1 is your first AP SSID p1 is the first AP password s2 and p2 are the same parameters but for the second AP h is the hostname given to the device by the Tasmota configuration After getting the incorrectly entered configuration from this URL, configure an access point with these settings as described above Access your device and set the correct Wi-Fi credentials If you flashed a light bulb or any device without a built-in button and entered wrong Wi-Fi password you now have a device that won't connect to your Wi-Fi and you have no button to force it into Wi-Fi configuration mode. This tip takes advantage of a security risk present in Arduino Cores prior to 2.6.0. It will not work with Tasmota binaries compiled with 2.6.0 or later. To solve this you can try creating a new Wi-Fi AP with the same SSID and no (none) authentication. Use an old router, a mobile phone or, if you're desperate, change the settings on your main router (but remember to turn authentication back on when you're done). Depending on the router/phone it will ignore the wrong Wi-Fi password since authentication is set to none and let your Tasmota flashed device connect to it. Now simply connect to the same AP and open the web UI, triple check your ssid and password, enter some simple info for SSID2 which you can create as a hotspot on your phone and save. Device disconnects from Wi-Fi often ~ First thing to try when having Wi-Fi issues: Reset 3 which will erase wi-fi calibration data only and will keep configuration intact. Make sure to power cycle restart after that. If that doesn't help try rebooting the router as well As a last resort try : Erase all flash using esptool.py or esptool.exe and flash via serial (as explained here ) using the latest precompiled binaries . This approach has solved many of the reported issues. Sometimes this is due to a bad flash, a bad OTA or invalid data that remains in the flash where the SDK memory is. If you still have issues, you should look into your Wi-Fi network: Some new routers have many modern features enabled with default which don't work well with the old ESP82xx chip. Disable any channel surfing, band changing and similar features. Check the Wi-Fi channel availability and noise with an Android app like Wi-Fi Analyzer. Disable Auto Channel in your Wi-Fi router and select any Wi-Fi channel that is not very congested in your area. Disable Wi-Fi Repeaters and Mesh Networks. Check Wi-Fi signal in your device. The same Mesh may be stable in one area and lead to unwanted Tasmota reconnects in other areas, presumably when the signals of access points overlap with similar strength. If disabling Mesh Networks is not an option, then keeping the network busy, e.g. by issuing a Ping from another host every 20 seconds has helped to avoid the reconnects. Wi-Fi Stops Working ~ There have been many reports of Wi-Fi no longer working after it was working for a while. Every time this has been reported, it's ended up being a hardware or signal interference problem. On the hardware side, we've seen reports of bad solder joints on the board that when touched up seem to solve the problem (capacitors being loose can cause this) or low quality/weak power supplies or voltage regulators that cannot cope with the power requirements of Tasmota or have degraded over time. We've also seen reports then when a specific LED light bulb was hooked up near one, the signal quality dropped to unusable. All you can really do is check the solder joints, move the device closer to your Access Point. If all else fails, replace the device. Weaker Wi-Fi signal after upgrade ~ On an ESP82xx, Wi-Fi calibration is sensitive to the power supplied. If this changes substantially (e.g., you add a sensor, configure a new Tasmota feature, upgrade the firmware or Arduino Core, etc.), the device's Wi-Fi calibration may not be set properly any longer. The Wi-Fi signal strength (RSSI) can drop significantly and impact Wi-Fi performance. In such a case, the Wi-Fi calibration needs to be deleted to force the device to re-calibrate Wi-Fi after it restarts. Run Reset 3 in the Console. The device will restart Cycle the power on the device. Wi-Fi calibration will not be done unless the device performs a cold boot from power up. WebUI unavailable but device can be controlled ~ Some routers have issues with ARP implementation. To help with that use SetOption41 to make your device send grauitous ARP in a desired interval (try 30 or 60 seconds for start). MQTT ~ Cannot connect to my MQTT broker ~ Make sure you've configured MQTT correctly. If that didn't solve the issue check your MQTT broker logs. Most likely problem is your broker doesn't allow logins for your Tasmota configure user and password or your ACL settings do not include your device. In some very specific cases the MQTT broker code clashes with the Arduino Core and doesn't allow a connection. In that case create a different user for your device, try another core binary or a different MQTT broker. Frequent MQTT reconnects ~ Most MQTT reconnect messages are linked with Wi-Fi instability first. Resolve any Wi-Fi issue first! If the console shows repeated messages like: 02 : 32 : 54 MQTT : tele /MYSONOFF/ LWT = Online ( retained ) 02 : 32 : 54 MQTT : cmnd /MYSONOFF/ POWER = 02 : 32 : 55 MQTT : Attempting connection ... 02 : 32 : 56 mDNS : Query done with 0 mqtt services found 02 : 32 : 56 MQTT : Connected or your mosquitto broker log shows messages like this - 1496455347 : New client connected from IP_addr_1 as SONOFF ( c1 , k15 , u 'SONOFF_USER' ). 1496455349 : New connection from IP_addr_1 on port 1883 . 1496455349 : Client SONOFF already connected , closing old connection . 1496455349 : Client SONOFF disconnected . 1496455349 : New client connected from IP_addr_2 as SONOFF ( c1 , k15 , u 'SONOFF_USER' ). 1496455350 : New connection from IP_addr_2 on port 1883 . 1496455350 : Client SONOFF already connected , closing old connection . 1496455350 : Client SONOFF disconnected . You have more than one device connected with the same %topic% defined. Its important that each device has a unique %topic% instead of the default sonoff . If that is not the issue, erase all flash using esptool.py or esptool.exe and flash again by wire (as explained here ) using the latest precompiled bins with core v2.7.1 . Configuration ~ Device reset to defaults on its own ~ Bad power supply Most common culprit is Power Cycle Recovery which can be activated if the device has a bad power supply or your power grid has fluctuations/brownouts. Disable the feature with SetOption65 1 Button in ON state when depressed If a button is configure to be in ON state when depressed it will activate \"Firmware Reset\" feature. Either change the button mode or use SetOption1 1 to disable factory reset mode. Frequent reboots/bootloops Your device may be in a boot loop - a restart caused by any exception or watchdog timer within less than BOOT_LOOP_TIME ( default 10 seconds ). The number of boot loops allowed before beginning to reset settings is determined by SetOption36 . When Tasmota reaches this situation, it will begin restoring default settings as follows: 1 st restart: disable ESP8285 generic GPIOs interfering with flash SPI 2 nd restart: disable rules causing boot loop 3 rd restart: disable all rules 4 th restart: reset user defined GPIOs to disable any attached peripherals 5 th restart: reset module to Sonoff Basic (1) Relay clicks and LED flashes at 1 second intervals ~ This indicates that your device did not get flashed properly. In this case it will toggle all it's pins at 1 sec intervals. A flash erase and a new flash is required. Status LED blinking ~ Your device status LED blinks repeatedly when Wi-Fi and/or MQTT is not connected. If you're not using MQTT and did not configure it the status LED will still keep blinking. You can disable status LED blinking using: Backlog LedPower 0; SetOption31 1 My device randomly switches on and off. Do I have ghosts in my house? ~ Most of the issues with random, or \"ghost\", switching are related to MQTT retain settings. In short, your MQTT broker is retaining a message with the POWER status of the device which gets applied on reboots. Solution here In some cases, adding a switch to a device causes ghost switching. In this case, you may need to add a low pass filter to dampen any spikes on the input. In the case of the Sonoff T1, a modification to change the filter capacitor on the PCB may be required. This short 10 minute video by TheHookUp nicely explains what it is and how to prevent it. Other cause can be of electrical nature. If you have connected an external switch using long wires they can pick up stray signals and cause the voltage on the GPIO to vary. Solution here Cannot find my device in Modules ~ If you flashed a device which is not listed in the Modules list, use Templates to configure your device. Try looking for it first in the Templates Repository . Device keeps restarting after changing config over MQTT ~ If you changed configurations over MQTT, the command can fail due to a bug and the command is repeatedly sent, causing the device to restart. The restart is normal if you change something at the device configuration. You need to clear the retain messages of your HA/Broker/MQTT Server.

It is polling your device with STATUS 0 command with a HTTP request every 5 seconds which causes the status updates and unnecessary stress load on the device. In some cases it might even interfere with normal device operation. Web Interface Asks for Password ~ You modified the Web Admin password ( Configure Other ) and now you cannot access the web interface. You have set up a password for the web interface. You can login with the username admin and the password you entered. However, if you don't remember that password there are a few options you can try to gain access to the web interface again. Reset the password using the WebPassword command. If you have serial connection to the device: Execute WebPassword 0 using a serial terminal interface. If you have configured MQTT: Send 0 to cmnd/<device-topic>/WebPassword . You can send it from any MQTT client . You can also use another Tasmota device using the Publish command - Execute Publish cmnd/<device-topic>/WebPassword 0 from that device's Console. If the options above are not available: Since Tasmota uses GET request for forms, the password may be in your browser history. Look there for entries with the name you configured for the device. For example, in the following link: http://<device-ip>/co?t1={\"NAME\":\"Generic\"'\"GPIO\":[23'22'24'17'134'132'0'0'131'52'21'0'0]'\"FLAG\":0'\"BASE\":67}&p1=SecretPassword&b1=on&a1=Sonoff&a2=Sonoff2&a3=Sonoff3&a4=Sonoff4&b2=0&save= the p1 parameter contains the password for the web interface ( SecretPassword in this case). Note: special characters may appear as the characters' corresponding ASCII hexadecimal codes (e.g., \"{\" = '\\%7B', etc.) If you had set up WifiConfig 7 as your Wi-Fi fallback method (by previously executing WiFiConfig in the Console), you can reset the device by booting it into Wi-Fi Manager mode. If the SSID configured in the device is not available (e.g., turn off the router), the device will fallback to that restricted Wi-Fi Manager Mode. If your device has a physical push-button, reset the firmware to the default settings as detailed here . If nothing helps, then you have to flash the firmware again using the serial interface. Be sure to erase the flash memory before uploading the binary. Power monitoring shows wrong values ~ If the values shown in the Web UI don't seem right and you're using a Supported Module you need to calibrate the power monitoring sensor . In case you're using a template you created yourself or found in our Templates Repository try the calibration method first. If the values are still wrong or unrealistic the power monitoring sensors' GPIOs are not configured correctly and you will need to find the correct GPIO assignments before proceeding. Sensors do not show values ~ Make sure your sensor is properly wired and the GPIOs assigned. Your vanilla tasmota.bin doesn't have complete sensor support. Make sure you've installed tasmota-sensors.bin that support the largest number of sensors. Some sensors require enabling in the code and compiling your own binary. See Builds for a comprehensive list of supported components. Timers trigger at the wrong time ~ Tasmota devices must have a their time of day set properly in order for any timers to work properly. Check the log in the web UI Console to see if the device's time is set correctly. There are two elements to setting the time: 1. obtaining the UTC time, and, 2. local Daylight Saving Time policies. There are three methods available to set the device time: 1. NTP , 2. An RTC peripheral , or 3. the Time command. The typical method Tasmota uses to set its time is to obtain the time from an Internet NTP server. It can also query an NTP server on its local network (e.g., a network router with an NTP service, a Raspberry Pi running the NTP daemon, the Chrony add-on in Home Assistant, etc.). Check the information about your router's features. If the router provides an NTP server, be sure to configure it properly. If the Tasmota device receives its IP address via DHCP from the router, Tasmota will request its time sync from the router's time server. This is managed by the Arduino core, not Tasmota ( #5283 ). Therefore, if the NTP server on the router is not configured, or configured improperly, the time on the Tasmota device could be wrong. If the router does not have a time server, this is not the problem. If you cannot configure your router's time server to the correct time (e.g., a router provided by your ISP with no access to administration functions), you will need to set a static IP address on the Tasmota device. If the device does not request its address from a DHCP server (i.e., uses a static IP address), the time sync request is forced to NTPSERVER1 . If can't connect, it tries NTPSERVER2 . And finally NTPSERVER3 . Ensure that these parameters are set appropriately and that the device can reach at least one of these time servers. You may want to consider setting up an NTP server locally. As long as the computer is able to set its time at some point from an Internet time server, this computer can serve as an NTP server for your Tasmota device(s). This can be the same computer that hosts your MQTT broker or home automation hub. You must also set the TimeZone and Daylight Saving Time policies ( TimeDST / TimeSTD ). If you have timers that use the sunset or sunrise times, you must set your latitude and longitude in order for these times to be calculated correctly for your location. Auto-discovery in Home Assistant does not work ~ The tasmota-lite.bin firmware binary (which comes packaged with Tuya-Convert) does not support auto-discovery. Please upgrade to tasmota.bin or a similar firmware variant that supports this feature. Make sure its enabled in Tasmota it with SetOption19 1 and you configured the Home Assistant MQTT integration with Discovery enabled. Why is my changed configuration not loaded? ~ If you have flashed a precompiled binary, be aware that all the configuration made after the flash (Wi-Fi, MQTT, topics, names, rules, etc) will be lost in a factory firmware reset. In short : The CFG_HOLDER is the place where the config is stored on your device. The device checks if a config is saved in this CFG_HOLDER (value from the my_user_config.h) and always loads this if exists. => won't load new applied configs in your my_user_config.h To get the new config on your device, you need to change the CFG_HOLDER. BUT: You should always try to stay on the default CFG_HOLDER, to reach this, you need to flash two times change your config in the my_user_config.h or better user_config_override.h change the CFG_HOLDER number. +1 or -1 is enough (e.g. 0x20161208) flash change the CFG_HOLDER back to default ( 0x20161209 ) flash again After this, your new config is saved in the default CFG_HOLDER on your device. This is necessary to avoid losing your config if you update to a new firmware by using the pre-build images or if you forget to change the CFG_HOLDER to your custom one if you build the firmware yourself. How CFG_HOLDER works : The config of your Tasmota is stored in an area of the flash memory (flash config area or FCA ). Using a new device (where Tasmota firmware runs the first time) the FCA does not contain a Tasmota configuration so on the very first start of Tasmota it uses your settings from my_user_config.h or user_config_override.h and copy this into the FCA. To prevent that the following Tasmota starts will overwrite your FCA settings again (e.g. because you has changed some things using commands) the FCA will be marked by a header value to indicate not copy the values from my_user_config.h / user_config_override.h again. This header becomes the value from CFG_HOLDER. On every start the device compares the header of FCA with the CFG_HOLDER from your source code and only if this header value is not identical, Tasmotat will copy the data from my_user_config.h/user_config_override.h to flash settings area - this is normally only the case on a fresh device or if you has changed the CFG_HOLDER value. Summary : To force Tasmota to overwrite current (valid or invalid) settings in FCA with your settings from my_user_config.h / user_config_override.h you can change CFG_HOLDER value once, compile, reflash device (as described above). To avoid overwriting settings by new versions don't forget either repeat the step above using original CFG_HOLDER value or never forget to change CFG_HOLDER value for even all upcoming version to your value or use the command Reset 1 or Reset 2 after changes in your my_user_config.h / user_config_override.h without the need to double reflash your device and/or double change your CFG_HOLDER value: change values in my_user_config.h / user_config_override.h leave CFG_HOLDER as is start your device and issue command Reset 1 or Reset 2 How do I invert the output of the green LED on the Sonoff Basic so the LED is on when the relay is off? ~ LedState default value is 1 (on) - Show power state on LED. The LED can be disabled completely with LedState 0 (off). However, there is no option to invert the output of the green LED on the Sonoff Basic. Flashing ~ Cannot enter flash mode ~ Be sure to press the button correctly, you must \"feel\" a click. If your on-device button doesn't allow you to enter flash mode or there is no GPIO0 broken out to the PCB, you can always bridge GND to GPIO0 pin directly on the chip. Search on the Internet for your chip's pinouts and use the tutorial . Be sure to keep GPIO0 grounded long enough (3-5 seconds) before disconnecting to ensure the chip has booted completely into programming mode. On devices that do not provide a GPIO0 connected button, it may be easier to leave the wired bridge in place throughout the entire flashing process (erase & upload). Doing so will not create any problems for flashing the device. After the firmware is uploaded successfully, remove the bridge. This allows the device to boot normally. Flashing issues ~ Double check if you wired the device the serial-to-USB adapter correctly. Almost every device needs RX and TX pins switched to TX and RX. See Hardware Preparation for more. Another common problem are the jumper cables used. Try another cable if you keep getting connection errors or check the cables for connectivity. Most of them are made cheaply and it happens quite often that those cables do not offer a good connection because of bad crimping or broken copper lines in them. Be sure to use a USB Data Cable and not a cheap loading cable for mobile phones for connecting the serial-to-USB adapter to your computer. If you are unsure, just try another USB cable. Data USB cables are often thicker than the normal loading cables (and more expensive). Another problem can be the difficulties in getting the ESP chip into programming mode when it boots. If the flash still fails or the progress interrupts, it could be that your computer or serial-to-USB adapter doesn't provide enough power to the device. Try another computer or use an external power supply (3.3V one). More infos about insufficient power Use the correct serial-to-USB adapter driver. Check the model of your adapter chip and get the correct driver. If the flash completes successfully, but you get a hash mismatch (esptool.py error message A fatal error occurred: MD5 of file does not match data in flash! ) ensure that your 3.3v current is sufficient. Workarounds include using a dedicated bread board power supply or using the 3.3v output of an additional microcontroller. If using an additional power supply to power the device, be sure to use a common ground for the power supply, the device to be flashed and the serial-to-USB adapter. If esptool.py stops at \"Uploading stub...\", use --no-stub If the flash fails or the device does not operate as expected, try using the default ESP82xx boot ROM baud rate - 74880 . This is the baud rate the ESP82xx is set to by default when it boots into programming mode. It can be specified as a command line option in esptool.py ( -b ) and esptool.exe ( -cb ). You may also want to select a serial monitor/terminal capable of setting this \"unusual\" baud rate. In Termite, type this value ( 74880 ) in the baud rate selection text box when configuring the port. Having the option to specify this unusual baud rate will allow you to view the ESP8266 boot ROM log while the device is booting. Device is hot to the touch ~ Remember - NEVER EVER FLASH WITH 5V! ? Better unpower your device and check if the wiring is correct and the voltage is on your FTDI is set to 3.3V. If you've connected VCC to the wrong pin it might cause your device to overheat and destroy it. There was white smoke and the device does not work anymore! ~ Yes, you've released the fabled \"white smoke\", the mysterious substance all electronic devices work on. In the immortal words of Doctor Bones: It's dead Jim! Sonoff 4CH V2 / Sonoff Dual V2 will not flash ~ Testing with two different (fairly new) FTDI boards and two Sonoff 4CH v2.0 and the Sonoff Dual v2.0 boards I found that I was getting errors uploading sketches i.e. \"warning: espcomm_sync failed\" basically a lack of communication between the two devices. I found that the problem in both Sonoff's was that instead of the FTDI Sonoff cross-over TX->RX and RX->TX I had to do TX->TX RX->RX this then allowed me to upload the sketch. Flashing fails on MacOS High Sierra ~ Related to issue #957 . Solution: Install the VCP drivers for Mac from the FTDI website After install, reboot (it does not work if you do not reboot). After reboot, plug the FTDI USB/serial converter. Accept the security alert from MacOS. Restart the flash process. It works! Miscellaneous ~ Can you add this unsupported sensor to Tasmota ~ Short answer: NO! Long answer: There is not enough time in our coders lives to take requests, if you can code a driver for that sensor and submit a PR it will be considered, otherwise you can only wait for someone else to do it. Available Characters for HOSTNAME ~ 24 chars max only a..z A..Z 0..9 '-' no '-' as last char RFC952 ASSUMPTIONS A \"name\" (Net, Host, Gateway, or Domain name) is a text string up to 24 characters drawn from the alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9), minus sign (-), and period (.). Note that periods are only allowed when they serve to delimit components of \"domain style names\". (See RFC-921, \"Domain Name System Implementation Schedule\", for background). No blank or space characters are permitted as part of a name. No distinction is made between upper and lower case. The first character must be an alpha character. The last character must not be a minus sign or period. A host which serves as a GATEWAY should have \"-GATEWAY\" or \"-GW\" as part of its name. Hosts which do not serve as Internet gateways should not use \"-GATEWAY\" and \"-GW\" as part of their names. A host which is a TAC should have \"-TAC\" as the last part of its host name, if it is a DoD host. Single character names or nicknames are not allowed. Flash Memory Considerations ~ To stop saving parameter changes to Flash or Spiffs use command SaveData off . To stop saving power changes only to Flash or Spiffs use command SetOption0 off . This will disable the relay from returning to the same state after power on UNLESS you use the MQTT retain flag in which case the MQTT broker will send the last known MQTT state on restart or power on. The command ButtonRetain on will configure the button to send a MQTT command with Topic and the MQTT retain flag set. What is an Arduino Core ~ Arduino Core (open source) are the core libraries for ESP8266/ESP8285 chips to make them Arduino Framework Compatible. This Core is programmed on top of the Espressif SDK (closed source). Tasmota is only using the core and does not maintain it or can help in solving issues with it. You can see the Arduino Core Version and the Espressif SDK Version on the Tasmota WebUI under the Information Menu entry.

Note: Since version 8.3.0 this requires 6 short presses instead. If that didn't work reset your device using Fast power cycle device recovery If you are unsure what SSID you have entered, you can try to find that with special Wi-Fi sniffing tools. For example Nirsoft WifiChannelMonitor can show your mistakenly configured SSID name. Linux system example: apt install aircrack-ng wireshark airmon-ng check kill airmon-ng start (e.g. wlp58s0 or wlan0) wireshark Select your Wi-Fi device from the list. Plug in the mis-configured device and immediately watch SSIDs. You should see your mis-configured SSID fairly soon. If these methods don't work, it may still be possible to save the device without opening it to perform a serial flash. Since Tasmota uses GET request for forms, the password may be in your browser history. Search in your browser history for 192.168.4.1 (or whatever address you used for configuring it) There should be an entry similar to this: http://192.168.4.1/wi?s1=<mySSID>&p1=<myPassword>-********&s2=&p2=********&h=hostName&save= s1 is your first AP SSID p1 is the first AP password s2 and p2 are the same parameters but for the second AP h is the hostname given to the device by the Tasmota configuration After getting the incorrectly entered configuration from this URL, configure an access point with these settings as described above Access your device and set the correct Wi-Fi credentials If you flashed a light bulb or any device without a built-in button and entered wrong Wi-Fi password you now have a device that won't connect to your Wi-Fi and you have no button to force it into Wi-Fi configuration mode. This tip takes advantage of a security risk present in Arduino Cores prior to 2.6.0. It will not work with Tasmota binaries compiled with 2.6.0 or later. To solve this you can try creating a new Wi-Fi AP with the same SSID and no (none) authentication. Use an old router, a mobile phone or, if you're desperate, change the settings on your main router (but remember to turn authentication back on when you're done). Depending on the router/phone it will ignore the wrong Wi-Fi password since authentication is set to none and let your Tasmota flashed device connect to it. Now simply connect to the same AP and open the web UI, triple check your ssid and password, enter some simple info for SSID2 which you can create as a hotspot on your phone and save.","title":"I entered wrong Wi-Fi information"},{"location":"FAQ/#device-disconnects-from-wi-fi-often","text":"First thing to try when having Wi-Fi issues: Reset 3 which will erase wi-fi calibration data only and will keep configuration intact. Make sure to power cycle restart after that. If that doesn't help try rebooting the router as well As a last resort try : Erase all flash using esptool.py or esptool.exe and flash via serial (as explained here ) using the latest precompiled binaries . This approach has solved many of the reported issues. Sometimes this is due to a bad flash, a bad OTA or invalid data that remains in the flash where the SDK memory is. If you still have issues, you should look into your Wi-Fi network: Some new routers have many modern features enabled with default which don't work well with the old ESP82xx chip. Disable any channel surfing, band changing and similar features. Check the Wi-Fi channel availability and noise with an Android app like Wi-Fi Analyzer. Disable Auto Channel in your Wi-Fi router and select any Wi-Fi channel that is not very congested in your area. Disable Wi-Fi Repeaters and Mesh Networks. Check Wi-Fi signal in your device. The same Mesh may be stable in one area and lead to unwanted Tasmota reconnects in other areas, presumably when the signals of access points overlap with similar strength. If disabling Mesh Networks is not an option, then keeping the network busy, e.g. by issuing a Ping from another host every 20 seconds has helped to avoid the reconnects.","title":"Device disconnects from Wi-Fi often"},{"location":"FAQ/#wi-fi-stops-working","text":"There have been many reports of Wi-Fi no longer working after it was working for a while.

And finally NTPSERVER3 . Ensure that these parameters are set appropriately and that the device can reach at least one of these time servers. You may want to consider setting up an NTP server locally. As long as the computer is able to set its time at some point from an Internet time server, this computer can serve as an NTP server for your Tasmota device(s). This can be the same computer that hosts your MQTT broker or home automation hub. You must also set the TimeZone and Daylight Saving Time policies ( TimeDST / TimeSTD ). If you have timers that use the sunset or sunrise times, you must set your latitude and longitude in order for these times to be calculated correctly for your location.","title":"Timers trigger at the wrong time"},{"location":"FAQ/#auto-discovery-in-home-assistant-does-not-work","text":"The tasmota-lite.bin firmware binary (which comes packaged with Tuya-Convert) does not support auto-discovery.

In short : The CFG_HOLDER is the place where the config is stored on your device. The device checks if a config is saved in this CFG_HOLDER (value from the my_user_config.h) and always loads this if exists. => won't load new applied configs in your my_user_config.h To get the new config on your device, you need to change the CFG_HOLDER. BUT: You should always try to stay on the default CFG_HOLDER, to reach this, you need to flash two times change your config in the my_user_config.h or better user_config_override.h change the CFG_HOLDER number. +1 or -1 is enough (e.g. 0x20161208) flash change the CFG_HOLDER back to default ( 0x20161209 ) flash again After this, your new config is saved in the default CFG_HOLDER on your device. This is necessary to avoid losing your config if you update to a new firmware by using the pre-build images or if you forget to change the CFG_HOLDER to your custom one if you build the firmware yourself. How CFG_HOLDER works : The config of your Tasmota is stored in an area of the flash memory (flash config area or FCA ). Using a new device (where Tasmota firmware runs the first time) the FCA does not contain a Tasmota configuration so on the very first start of Tasmota it uses your settings from my_user_config.h or user_config_override.h and copy this into the FCA. To prevent that the following Tasmota starts will overwrite your FCA settings again (e.g. because you has changed some things using commands) the FCA will be marked by a header value to indicate not copy the values from my_user_config.h / user_config_override.h again. This header becomes the value from CFG_HOLDER. On every start the device compares the header of FCA with the CFG_HOLDER from your source code and only if this header value is not identical, Tasmotat will copy the data from my_user_config.h/user_config_override.h to flash settings area - this is normally only the case on a fresh device or if you has changed the CFG_HOLDER value. Summary : To force Tasmota to overwrite current (valid or invalid) settings in FCA with your settings from my_user_config.h / user_config_override.h you can change CFG_HOLDER value once, compile, reflash device (as described above). To avoid overwriting settings by new versions don't forget either repeat the step above using original CFG_HOLDER value or never forget to change CFG_HOLDER value for even all upcoming version to your value or use the command Reset 1 or Reset 2 after changes in your my_user_config.h / user_config_override.h without the need to double reflash your device and/or double change your CFG_HOLDER value: change values in my_user_config.h / user_config_override.h leave CFG_HOLDER as is start your device and issue command Reset 1 or Reset 2","title":"Why is my changed configuration not loaded?"},{"location":"FAQ/#how-do-i-invert-the-output-of-the-green-led-on-the-sonoff-basic-so-the-led-is-on-when-the-relay-is-off","text":"LedState default value is 1 (on) - Show power state on LED.

Be sure to keep GPIO0 grounded long enough (3-5 seconds) before disconnecting to ensure the chip has booted completely into programming mode. On devices that do not provide a GPIO0 connected button, it may be easier to leave the wired bridge in place throughout the entire flashing process (erase & upload).

Almost every device needs RX and TX pins switched to TX and RX. See Hardware Preparation for more. Another common problem are the jumper cables used. Try another cable if you keep getting connection errors or check the cables for connectivity. Most of them are made cheaply and it happens quite often that those cables do not offer a good connection because of bad crimping or broken copper lines in them. Be sure to use a USB Data Cable and not a cheap loading cable for mobile phones for connecting the serial-to-USB adapter to your computer. If you are unsure, just try another USB cable. Data USB cables are often thicker than the normal loading cables (and more expensive). Another problem can be the difficulties in getting the ESP chip into programming mode when it boots. If the flash still fails or the progress interrupts, it could be that your computer or serial-to-USB adapter doesn't provide enough power to the device. Try another computer or use an external power supply (3.3V one). More infos about insufficient power Use the correct serial-to-USB adapter driver. Check the model of your adapter chip and get the correct driver. If the flash completes successfully, but you get a hash mismatch (esptool.py error message A fatal error occurred: MD5 of file does not match data in flash! ) ensure that your 3.3v current is sufficient. Workarounds include using a dedicated bread board power supply or using the 3.3v output of an additional microcontroller. If using an additional power supply to power the device, be sure to use a common ground for the power supply, the device to be flashed and the serial-to-USB adapter. If esptool.py stops at \"Uploading stub...\", use --no-stub If the flash fails or the device does not operate as expected, try using the default ESP82xx boot ROM baud rate - 74880 . This is the baud rate the ESP82xx is set to by default when it boots into programming mode. It can be specified as a command line option in esptool.py ( -b ) and esptool.exe ( -cb ). You may also want to select a serial monitor/terminal capable of setting this \"unusual\" baud rate. In Termite, type this value ( 74880 ) in the baud rate selection text box when configuring the port.

The current ESP8266 GPIO function configuration supports 216 GPIO functions like Relay1 (21) or Inverted Button1 (122). The current implementation supports up to 250 functions as it is confined to 8-bits uint8_t arrays. As more devices need to be connected it would become impossible to have them addressed with this 8-bit scheme. Another problem is that the current implementation would need GUI drop down boxes with up to 250 items which is hard to use. Also user templates still need to be able to address all possible GPIO functions. To solve this issue I needed to change from 8-bit uint8_t to 16-bit uint16_t arrays. Without further action this would result in even more entries in the GUI drop down boxes and made adding more relays/buttons/switches etc also very cumbersome. As the ESP32 would need to be supported too a challenge lay ahead. I decided for the following option where every GPIO function type (relays, buttons, switches) would have an id allowing for 32 devices. So every GPIO function would be offset by 32 (or 5-bits). These 5-bits can be used in the future to easily expand current max values like 4 buttons or 8 relays to max 32. How this works could have been seen in the ESP32 implementation as released some month ago. The GUI now contains two drop down boxes, one for the GPIO function (Relay) and one for the function index (1 to 8). For the ESP8266 the current maxed GPIO functions of 216 will be fixed an any new device will be using the GPIO addressing scheme. To make transistion transparent a table is used to convert current 216 GPIO 8-bit function numbers to new 16-bit function numbers. As both are offset from 0 there will be some duplication in numbering so the only way to distinguish them by external programs like TDM is by checking the Tasmota verion number; Below 9.0 will be 8-bit GPIO, Starting with development version 9.0.0.1 it will be 16-bit GPIO. See below how the numbers are being converted. The first number is 8-bit GPIO, the second the 16-bit GPIO.

Serial-to-USB Adapter The power supplied to the device is one of the most important elements for both flashing the device and for stable operation. You must ensure that the device receives sufficient power (current AND appropriate voltage level) to properly flash the firmware on the device. CH340G is a reliable and very cheap adapter (example 1 , 2 ). FTDI FT232 - these adapters have a lot of fakes in the market so buy only from reliable sources ( example ). Buy only the variant with a separate 3.3V regulator on PCB! CP2102 or PL2303 - works with certain devices, but using an external 3.3V supply might be necessary. Not recommended for beginners! RaspberryPi - only for advanced users. External 3.3V supply necessary. NodeMCU and D1 mini (Pro/Lite) boards have a micro USB upload port and don't require an adapter. Note Don't forget to install drivers for your serial-to-USB adapter. Danger Some adapters can be switched between 3.3V and 5V for the data pins, but still provide 5V on the power pin which will fry your device. You MUST make sure both the data and VCC pins are set for 3.3V. Soldering Tools To solder you'll of course need a soldering iron, soldering tin and some flux. If you're new to soldering check out some soldering tutorial videos while you're at it. If you're intimidated by soldering you could get away with holding the headers with jumper wires in the pin holes during flashing but it is not a fool proof process and flashing might fail. Jumper wires You could use any kind of wire but jumper wires (also called DuPont wires) are more practical than soldering and desoldering. Pin Headers Pin headers come in male or female version. Choose according to your jumper wire connectors. Computer with Linux, Windows or MacOS You need a computer with a USB port to upload the firmware to your device and configure it. Smartphone Tasmota installed from a precompiled binary needs to be configured to work with your Wi-Fi network before you can access the Tasmota web UI. This is usually done by connecting to a Tasmota Wi-Fi Access Point with your smartphone (or tablet or computer with Wi-Fi). Needed Software ~ Tasmota Firmware Binary Download a Tasmota firmware binary file (.bin). If you're not sure which binary is the right one for you just start with tasmota.bin or consult the builds table to see which features you need. Official release binaries can be downloaded from GitHub releases or from our OTA server . Latest development branch binaries are available only from our OTA server . The latest merged development code is compiled hourly. Flashing Tool Tasmotizer - NEW flashing and firmware download tool just for Tasmota. (Windows, Linux or Mac) Tasmota PyFlasher - flashing tool intended for Tasmota. (Windows or Mac) NodeMCU PyFlasher - easy to use GUI flasher based on esptool.py. (Windows or Mac) Esptool.py - the official flashing tool from Espressif. (Requires Python) Esptool executable - Esptool in executable form, no Python required. (Windows, Linux or Mac) Serial Terminal A program that connects to your Tasmota device directly over the serial connection you used to flash it. This is an optional way to configure your device using Commands and Backlog . Termite - simple terminal for windows Termie - open source clone of Termite Putty - popular client available on every platform Minicom - one of many Linux terminals Tip Enable local echo so that you can see what is typed and transmitted to the device. Enable Append CR+LF since every request needs to end with <CR><LF> . MQTT Knowledge ~ Tasmota is designed to be controlled and communicate via MQTT . To use it to its fullest potential you need an MQTT broker . Read our article on MQTT to learn why it is essential in Tasmota. Compiling Tools (Optional) ~ If you want to modify the code or default settings and compile your own Tasmota firmware . Hardware Preparation ~ We need to connect to the serial programming interface of the ESP8266 chip. This is done by connecting our serial-to-USB converter TX and RX pins to the ESP8266 RX and TX pins and powering the chip with the 3.3V and GND pins. In most cases those pins are available on the PCB in the form of pin holes or solder pads but pin headers or jumper wires need to be soldered or otherwise applied. In some cases you will need to solder wires directly on the chip's pins which requires some experience and good soldering equipment. BEWARE! DO NOT CONNECT DEVICES TO MAINS POWER WHILE THE COVER IS OPEN AND CIRCUIT BOARD IS EXPOSED!!! NEVER TRY TO FLASH WHILE YOUR DEVICE IS CONNECTED TO MAINS POWER!!! YOU CAN BE ELECTROCUTED IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING! If you are not careful, your own health will be in danger. Shorting your serial interface with mains AC power will fry your device and serial adapter and will also harm or destroy your computer. It is important to always have all mains power cables disconnected from the device while being connected via serial or even while the case of the device is opened. Serial Connection ~ Each device has its pins labelled differently. If the labelling isn't visible on the PCB please refer to the devices flashing guide or search the Internet for correct pin locations. Device specific instructions and restrictions are documented in the Tasmota Device Templates Repository When you have identified pins on your device, connect wires according to the table: Serial adapter ESP8266 device 3V3 3V3 or VCC TX RX RX TX GND GND Note that TX from your adapter goes to RX on the ESP8266 device and RX from adapter goes to TX on the device! Programming Mode ~ ESP8266 needs to be put into programming mode or flash mode before the firmware can be uploaded. This is done by pulling the GPIO0 pin to GND while the chip is booting. On most devices the installed control button is connected to GPIO0 and GND, making entering Programming Mode very easy. On others you will need to bridge the pins on the PCB or directly on the chip with a jumper wire. GPIO0 is always in the same location on ESP8266 and ESP8285! Device specific instructions are documented in Tasmota Device Templates Repository . To put the ESP8266 into Programming Mode: Disconnect serial-to-USB adapter and power Bridge GPIO0 and GND (by pressing the on-board button or connection with a wire) Connect the serial-to-USB adapter to your computer After a few seconds disconnect GPIO0 from GND (release button or remove the wire connection). On devices that do not provide the GPIO0 connected button, it may be easier to leave the wired bridge in place throughout the entire flashing process (erase & upload). Doing so will not create any problems. After the firmware is uploaded successfully, remove the bridge. This allows the device to boot normally. You can test whether your device is in Programming Mode by attempting to read information from the ESP82xx chip. This requires esptool.py . Instructions on installing and using esptool are provided below . For example ( COM5 will be your COM port): esptool.py -p COM5 read_mac (It should read the MAC address. It may fail afterwards during Uploading and running a \"stub\". This is normal.) esptool.py -p COM5 flash_id If everything went well, you are now in Programming Mode and ready to continue with flashing . If the flashing process is unable to start, disconnect the device and retry the steps. Common Mistakes ~ Wire connections and solder joints - Double check all connections and also check for solder overflow. Use a USB data cable - Some USB cables are for charging only and do not connect the data lines needed to load the firmware onto the device. Insufficient power delivered over the serial-to-USB adapter. This leads to flashing failures or corrupted flash altogether. Supply more power with a separate 3.3V power supply or get an adapter with a better power supply. Be sure all DC voltages use the same GND reference. Recheck your serial-to-USB adapter so to ensure that it supplies 3.3V voltage and NOT 5V . 5V will damage the ESP chip! Releasing GPIO0 button/wire before booting is finished - It is safe to leave GPIO0 connected to GND during the entire programming process (erase & upload). Just be sure to remove the GPIO0 to GND bridge before booting the device for regular operation. Make sure that the RX pin is connected to the TX pin between the serial adapter and your ESP device, and vice versa. Erase the flash memory first and cycle power afterwards before uploading the Tasmota firmware binary. Not erasing can leave behind remnants of the previous flash contents which can interfere with the new firmware operation. Flashing ~ If you have followed Hardware preparation , your device should be in Flash Mode and ready for a Tasmota firmware binary file to be flashed. For that you need a flashing tool . Tip You may want to back up the device manufacturer's firmware on the one in a million chance you don't like Tasmota. Tasmotizer! ~ Tasmotizer! is specifically designed for use with Tasmota with an easy to use GUI and esptool.py under the hood. Download the latest release for your platform. In Windows just double click the downloaded file and it'll start, no installation required. For python follow the installation instructions . Video tutorial by SuperHouseTV Note If you get an anti-virus infection warning don't fret, it is a known false positive . If you're still apprehensive you can always run the Python version. It is time to Tasmotize! Connect your device to the serial-to-USB adapter or plug in NodeMCU/D1 mini. Check whether the correct serial port (COM or tty port) is selected. Tasmotizer! will try its best to select the right one for you. Choose Tasmota firmware binary: BIN file - browse to the Tasmota firmware binary you downloaded or compiled. Release - select from a list of available release binaries Development - select from a list of latest development binaries optional Backup the original device firmware Erase flash Danger Leave Erase before flashing checked if it is the first time flashing Tasmota on the device or you're experiencing issues with the existing flash and need to do a full erase. If you're upgrading an already flashed Tasmota and wish to keep your settings, uncheck Erase before flashing . Click Tasmotize and wait until done. If the flash was successful it will display: Unplug your serial programming adapter or device and plug it back in or connect to another power source. You can use Send Config Tasmotizer! button for the initial configuration of your device instead of webUI. esptool.py ~ Esptool is the official Espressif tool for flashing ESP8266 chips. It requires Python, if you do not have an installed copy of Python 2.x or 3.x download and install it from https://www.python.org. Download the esptool Source code to a folder of your choice. Go to the folder and install Esptool with command python setup.py install Upload Tasmota Make sure you followed the steps to put your device in flash mode. Place your chosen firmware binary file in the same folder as esptool.py. Esptool uses the serial interface to communicate with your device. On Windows these interfaces are named COM1, COM2, etc. and on Linux they are named /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc. Before using esptool, make sure you know which serial port your programming adapter is connected to. The following use COM5 as an example. Change COM5 with your serial port designation. Ensure the device is in flash mode before each step. Backup Firmware (optional step) Backup the current firmware with the following command: esptool . py -- port COM5 read_flash 0x00000 0x100000 fwbackup . bin When the command completes the device is not in flash mode anymore. Repeat the process of putting your device in programming mode. Erase Flash Memory Erase the complete flash memory holding the firmware with the following command: esptool . py -- port COM5 erase_flash It only takes a few seconds to erase 1M of flash. When the command completes the device is not in flash mode anymore. Repeat the process of putting your device in programming mode. Upload Firmware Load the chosen Tasmota firmware file with the following command (e.g., tasmota.bin in this example): esptool . py -- port COM5 write_flash - fs 1 MB - fm dout 0x0 tasmota . bin Unplug your serial programming adapter or your device and plug it back in or connect to another power source. Your device is now ready for Initial configuration . For proper device initialization after the firmware upload completes, power down and power up the device. Esptool Executable ~ The executable version of esptool is maintained by Ivan Grokhotkov and releases are kept at https://github.com/igrr/esptool-ck/releases . Supports Linux, Linux ARM, Windows 32-bit and Mac First Step For the purpose of simplicity only the Windows version will be explained here, but the commands and parameters are the same for Windows, Linux and Mac. Download the latest release of Esptool-CK and extract the compressed file to a folder of your choice. Place your chosen firmware binary file (e.g., tasmota.bin in the example below) in the same folder as Esptool-CK to simplify the process. The following commands use COM5 as an example. Change COM5 with your port designation. Ensure the device is in flash mode before each step. Erase Flash Memory esptool - cp COM5 - ce - v Upload firmware Once the erase is complete, put device back into programming mode and upload the firmware esptool - cp COM5 - bm dout - cf tasmota . bin - v Unplug your serial programming adapter or your device and plug it back in or connect to another power source. Your device is now ready for Initial configuration . For proper device initialization after the firmware upload completes, power down and power up the device. OTA Conversion Tasmota is NOT a developer of these tools. For help and troubleshooting you will need to get support from those projects . Tuya-Convert - easy OTA flash for devices with Tuya chips, no disassembly required Sonoff DIY - OTA flash for select Sonoff devices (some disassembly required) You've successfully flashed your device with a downloaded binary of Tasmota but now you need to connect the tasmotised device to your Wi-Fi network. Initial Configuration ~ Using Web UI ~ Configure Wi-Fi Tasmota provides a wireless access point for easy Wi-Fi configuration. If you flashed using Tuya Convert this is the only option to set up your device. Connect your device to a power source and grab your smartphone (or tablet or laptop or any other web and Wi-Fi capable device). Search for a Wi-Fi AP named tasmota_XXXXXX-#### (where XXXXXX is a string derived from the device's MAC address and #### is a number) and connect to it. In this example the Wi-Fi AP is named tasmota_3D5E26-7718 . When it connects to the network, you may get a warning that there is no Internet connection and be prompted to connect to a different network. Do not allow the mobile device to select a different network . !!! warning Wi-Fi manager server is active for only 3 minutes. If you miss the window you might have to disconnect your device from power and reconnect. After you have connected to the Tasmota Wi-Fi AP, open http://192.168.4.1 in a web browser on the smartphone (or whatever device you used). Depending on the phone, it will take you to the Tasmota configuration page automatically, or you will get a prompt to *sign in to Wi-Fi network* or *authorize*. Tapping on the AP name should also open the configuration page. At this page you can have Tasmota scan for available Wi-Fi networks. Select the right network from the list or enter the following: **AP1 SSid** - your Wi-Fi network name _SSID's are case sensitive_ **AP1 Password** - password for your Wi-Fi AP Wi-Fi password has to be under 32 characters and without special characters (e.g. asterisks) or white spaces *Recommended:* **AP2 SSid** - alternative Wi-Fi network SSID **AP2 Password** - password for your alternative Wi-Fi AP Click the checkbox to see the password you enter to ensure that it is correct and that your mobile device has not inadvertently capitalized the first letter if it is supposed to be lower case nor autocorrected what you entered. ~~Double~~ **Triple check the Wi-Fi credentials** and click on **Save** to apply the settings. The device will restart and connect to your home network. The _tasmota_XXXXXX-####_ network will not longer be present. Therefore your smartphone will automatically be disconnected and should connect back to its data network. !!! tip If you're not using a second Wi-Fi network you can enter an SSID without a password you can connect to as a backup in case something went wrong with your Wi-Fi credentials. #### Configure MQTT Look in your router for a newly connected device with the same name as the Wi-Fi access point. _In our example it is **tasmota_3D5E26-7718**._ !!! tip \" `tasmota_XXXXXX` is also the firmware default MQTT topic for that device\" If you don't have access to your router you can find your newly flashed device with an IP scanner: * [Fing](https://www.fing.com/products/) - for Android or iOS * [Angry IP Scanner](https://angryip.org/) - open source for Linux, Windows and Mac. Requires Java. * [Super Scan](https://sectools.org/tool/superscan/) - Windows only too (free) * [Tasmota Device Locator](http://tasmota.simplethings.work/) - Browser-based Open the IP address with your web browser and you have full access to Tasmota. Now is the time to set up [MQTT](MQTT.md) and the last remaining, but equally important, step: #### Configure Template or Module Configure your device using [Templates](Templates.md) in **Configuration - Configure Template** or [Modules](Modules.md) in **Configuration - Configure Module**. Your device running Tasmota is now ready to be [controlled](Commands.md). !!! quote \"Check out all the supported devices in [Tasmota Device Templates Repository](https://templates.blakadder.com/)\" #### Configure Other (optional) Configure your device name which is displayed in webUI and used for [Home Assistant autodiscovery](Home-Assistant.md). Configure web admin password for the webUI. Default username is `admin`. This type of security is rudimentary since Tasmota doesn't use HTTPS, do not expose your device outside of your local network. ### Using Serial Terminal If you flashed the device using serial-to-USB adapter (or it is a NodeMCU/D1 mini) you can take advantage of the existing connection and configure your device over the serial connection using [Commands](Commands.md). First you will need a [Serial Terminal](#serial-terminal) program. *In this example [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm) on Windows is used.* Download Termite and extract the .exe file, no installation necessary. Connect your serial-to-USB adapter or NodeMCU/D1 mini to the computer. ![Termite setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5904370/55745914-abe39d00-5a38-11e9-91d8-1b8e16ed34d3.png) Open Termite and set it to the proper COM port (*Termite selects the first available port by default*). Set Baud rate to 115200 and Forward to none. ![First boot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5904370/55746947-5e1c6400-5a3b-11e9-871f-11ac80e40205.png) Connect your device to the serial-to-USB adapter. You should see the initial boot output in Termite. If your screen is empty type `status` in the bottom command bar and hit enter. If you get a return message from your device similar to the one displayed under purple `status` you're all set. To configure Tasmota you need to issue commands, some commands will reboot your device and to avoid that we will use the `Backlog` command feature. Configure your Wi-Fi network and a secondary Wi-Fi network Backlog ssid1 <yourssid>; password1 <your_password>; ssid2 <your_ssid2>; password2 <your_password> ![After restart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5904370/55748616-69718e80-5a3f-11e9-8b58-4d15c1816e71.png) Device will restart and connect to your network. It will display your devices newly assigned IP. Direct your web browser to that IP address to access the Web UI for further configuration and contol. Configure MQTT broker address, MQTT credentials, unique device topic and OTA url to the latest official release Backlog mqtthost <yourhost>; mqttuser <user>; mqttpassword <password>; topic <unique_topic>; otaurl http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/tasmota.bin !!! tip Keep your personal configuration in a text file and simply copy and paste the backlog commands to a newly flashed device. ## After Configuration Your device is connected to your network and to the MQTT broker. One last thing to do is configure your device using [Templates](Templates.md) in **Configuration - Configure Template** or [Modules](Modules.md) in **Configuration - Configure Module**. !!! quote \"Check out all the supported devices in [Tasmota Device Templates Repository](https://templates.blakadder.com/)\" !!! warning If you experience power fluctuations in your power grid its best to immediately disable [Power Cycle Recovery](Device-Recovery.md#fast-power-cycle-device-recovery) feature with command [`SetOption65 1`](Commands.md#setoption65) immediately or you might end up with firmware defaults on your device. [Commands](Commands.md) and Backlog are powerful and in time you can learn to configure almost everything (NTP servers, longitude and latitude, custom device options, etc) with a few copy and paste moves.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#prerequisites","text":"","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#needed-hardware","text":"","title":"Needed Hardware"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#needed-software","text":"","title":"Needed Software"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#mqtt-knowledge","text":"Tasmota is designed to be controlled and communicate via MQTT .

Tasmota communicates with Home Assistant using MQTT. Before going any further, make sure MQTT is properly set up in Home Assistant and in Tasmota . First, test if the two can communicate. In Home Assistant web UI go to Settings - Integrations - Configure MQTT Broker * . Subscribe to tele/%topic%/STATE and click * START LISTENING . You should see a JSON response from your device. To test control of a relay or light, as Publish a packet topic enter cmnd/%topic%/POWER with payload toggle . When you click PUBLISH your device should switch state and a JSON resc Home Assistant has two avenues of adding Tasmota devices: Using MQTT discovery Adding by editing configuration.yaml After every change to the configuration.yaml file you'll need to restart Home Assistant to make it aware of the changes. If you don't want to use MQTT discovery, skip to Manual Configuration Automatic Discovery ~ Home Assistant has a feature called MQTT discovery . With MQTT discovery no user interaction or configuration file editing is needed to add new devices in Home Assistant. Most of the changes will be updated in HA automatically. Note Automatic discovery is currently supported for (see details below): - Buttons - Lights - Relays - Sensors - Switches Enable Autodiscovery ~ Enable autodiscovery on a device with the command: SetOption19 1 Discovery is not built in to tasmota-lite.bin. Use the full version (tasmota.bin) or other binaries that support discovery. After the automatic discovery feature is enabled a retained MQTT message starting with topic \"homeassistant/\" is sent to the broker. That message contains your device configuration which will be picked up and used by Home Assistant to automatically add your device to MQTT integrations. Tasmota uses DeviceName to identify the device in Home Assistant MQTT integration and FriendlyName<x> to identify power outputs (switch or light entities in HA). When changing some settings you might need a reboot or use SetOption19 1 again to see the new changes under Home Assistant. Special settings for each device type: Supported Entities ~ Buttons Announced to Home Assistant as Automation Trigger . To have buttons discovered SetOption73 must be set to 1 and it will automatically start to listen and publish using /stat/%topic%/BUTTON<x>T topic. Discovery will follow all the possible combinations made using SetOption1, SetOption11 and Setoption13. Lights Announced to Home Assistant as MQTT Light . Discovery supports single channel Dimmer as well as multi-channel RGB, RGBW, RGBCCT and CCT lights. To have multi-channel PWM instead of a single light entity under Home Assistant use SetOption68 1 . If you have a light with 4 or 5 channels (RGB+W or RGB+CCT) you can split them into two separate lights, first one for RGB and second for White/CT. Note Tasmota will no longer switch %prefix% and %topic% and will keep the default topic structure. This could lead to a very long topic for a light and autodiscovery could fail to parse the necessary code for Home Assistant. In this case a warning will be shown in the logs and Tasmota Console. To avoid this issue keep your Topic and/or FriendlyName as short as possible. Alternatively you can configure it manually using Light integration. Warning Pay attention to the order of the relays when used in conjunction with lights. The relays have priority over the lights, an incorrect order could lead to an erroneous light control. Add them starting from relay1. Entities for relays and lights will not be available in Home Assistant until the configuration will be updated. Relays Announced to Home Assistant as MQTT Switch . To make a relay discovered as \"light\" in Home Assistant use command SetOption30 1 Alternatively you can configure it manually using Light Switch integration. Warning Pay attention to the order of the relays when used in conjunction with lights. The relays have priority over the lights, an incorrect order could lead to an erroneous light control. Add them starting from relay1. Entities for relays and lights will not be available in Home Assistant until the configuration will be updated. Sensors Announced to Home Assistant as MQTT Sensor . When discovery is enabled Tasmota will send all the sensors information to Home Assistant. For each sensor present, entities will be created in numbers equal to the items present below him. Example: An AM2301 sensor will generate one entity for Temperature, one for Humidity and one for Dew point. Warning Please be advised that not all sensors can be correctly rendered under Home Assistant. In those cases a fallback function will be used to create a generic sensor and the correct operation is not guaranteed. Switches Announced to Home Assistant as MQTT Binary Sensor and/or as an Automation Trigger . To have switches discovered SwitchTopic must be set to a custom name and it will automatically start to listen and publish using stat/%topic%/SWITCH<x> (binary sensor) or stat/%topic%/SWITCH<x>T (trigger) topics. Depending by the SwitchMode used, a switch can be a Trigger ( TOGGLE or HOLD ), a Binary Sensor ( ON / OFF ) or both at the same time. Example: When using with SwitchMode 0 Tasmota will create just one Trigger for TOGGLE . When using with SwitchMode 1 Tasmota will create a Binary Sensor with ON and OFF Payloads. When using with Switchmode 5 Tasmota will create a Binary Sensor with ON and OFF Payloads and a Trigger for TOGGLE . All switchmodes are supported with the sole exception of SwitchMode11 and SwitchMode12 able to generate just a TOGGLE trigger. When a switch is set to a different topic than 0 is not possible to use Switch#State as a trigger for rules. Types of devices not listed above (fans, covers, TuyaMCU devices, etc) require manual configuration Finalising Setup ~ All automatically discovered entities will show up under Configuration -> Integrations -> MQTT card. The entities are grouped under a device defined by DeviceName and identified by Tasmota as the \"manufacturer\": Overview of a Tasmota device in Home Assistant integration compared to Configuration -> Configure Other : For every device an informative sensor will be created automatically: This sensor will update on TelePeriod which is 5 minutes by default It will show as \"Unavailable\" until the first TelePeriod MQTT message You can further customise your device in Home Assistant by clicking on the entity name. Enabling discovery will automatically change some SetOptions to suit the new configuration SetOption4 to 0 : Return MQTT response always as RESULT and not as %COMMAND% topic SetOption17 to 1 : Show Color as a comma-separated decimal string instead of hexadecimal SetOption59 to 1 : Send tele/%topic%/STATE in addition to stat/%topic%/RESULT for commands State , Power and any command causing a light to be turned on. Disabling ~ To disable MQTT discovery and remove the retained message, execute SetOption19 0 . The \"homeassistant/\" topic is removed from Home Assistant and MQTT broker. Changed setoptions will not revert to defaults! configuration.yaml editing ~ The advantage of manually configuring a device is that you maintain control of all aspects of the configuration. Home Assistant configuration is done by editing the configuration.yaml file. All the configurations are just examples. You need to be familiar with Home Assistant's configuration structure and procedures. Straight copy paste of the given examples into configuration.yaml will not work for you. If you are using a localized (non-english) version be sure to check the correct spelling and cases for values: 'payload_available' 'payload_not_available' 'payload_on' 'payload_off' Tip If you want the power states to be persistent in Tasmota and Home Assistant set PowerRetain 1 instead of using retain: true in Home Assistant Switches ~ Add in Home Assistant using the MQTT Switch integration.

After the automatic discovery feature is enabled a retained MQTT message starting with topic \"homeassistant/\" is sent to the broker. That message contains your device configuration which will be picked up and used by Home Assistant to automatically add your device to MQTT integrations. Tasmota uses DeviceName to identify the device in Home Assistant MQTT integration and FriendlyName<x> to identify power outputs (switch or light entities in HA). When changing some settings you might need a reboot or use SetOption19 1 again to see the new changes under Home Assistant. Special settings for each device type:","title":"Enable Autodiscovery"},{"location":"Home-Assistant/#supported-entities","text":"Buttons Announced to Home Assistant as Automation Trigger . To have buttons discovered SetOption73 must be set to 1 and it will automatically start to listen and publish using /stat/%topic%/BUTTON<x>T topic. Discovery will follow all the possible combinations made using SetOption1, SetOption11 and Setoption13. Lights Announced to Home Assistant as MQTT Light . Discovery supports single channel Dimmer as well as multi-channel RGB, RGBW, RGBCCT and CCT lights. To have multi-channel PWM instead of a single light entity under Home Assistant use SetOption68 1 . If you have a light with 4 or 5 channels (RGB+W or RGB+CCT) you can split them into two separate lights, first one for RGB and second for White/CT. Note Tasmota will no longer switch %prefix% and %topic% and will keep the default topic structure. This could lead to a very long topic for a light and autodiscovery could fail to parse the necessary code for Home Assistant. In this case a warning will be shown in the logs and Tasmota Console. To avoid this issue keep your Topic and/or FriendlyName as short as possible. Alternatively you can configure it manually using Light integration. Warning Pay attention to the order of the relays when used in conjunction with lights. The relays have priority over the lights, an incorrect order could lead to an erroneous light control. Add them starting from relay1. Entities for relays and lights will not be available in Home Assistant until the configuration will be updated. Relays Announced to Home Assistant as MQTT Switch . To make a relay discovered as \"light\" in Home Assistant use command SetOption30 1 Alternatively you can configure it manually using Light Switch integration. Warning Pay attention to the order of the relays when used in conjunction with lights. The relays have priority over the lights, an incorrect order could lead to an erroneous light control. Add them starting from relay1. Entities for relays and lights will not be available in Home Assistant until the configuration will be updated. Sensors Announced to Home Assistant as MQTT Sensor . When discovery is enabled Tasmota will send all the sensors information to Home Assistant. For each sensor present, entities will be created in numbers equal to the items present below him. Example: An AM2301 sensor will generate one entity for Temperature, one for Humidity and one for Dew point. Warning Please be advised that not all sensors can be correctly rendered under Home Assistant. In those cases a fallback function will be used to create a generic sensor and the correct operation is not guaranteed. Switches Announced to Home Assistant as MQTT Binary Sensor and/or as an Automation Trigger . To have switches discovered SwitchTopic must be set to a custom name and it will automatically start to listen and publish using stat/%topic%/SWITCH<x> (binary sensor) or stat/%topic%/SWITCH<x>T (trigger) topics. Depending by the SwitchMode used, a switch can be a Trigger ( TOGGLE or HOLD ), a Binary Sensor ( ON / OFF ) or both at the same time. Example: When using with SwitchMode 0 Tasmota will create just one Trigger for TOGGLE . When using with SwitchMode 1 Tasmota will create a Binary Sensor with ON and OFF Payloads. When using with Switchmode 5 Tasmota will create a Binary Sensor with ON and OFF Payloads and a Trigger for TOGGLE .

About HomeSeer HS3 is the industry standard for flexible, powerful, home automation software. A wide selection of software drivers (plug-ins) is available for use with scores of home automation technologies and products. The following forum link provides a guide to upload Tasmota to an S20 using SonOTA and integrate it with HomeSeer HS3 using the mcsMQTT plugin. Here is a guide for integrating HomeSeer HS3 with the Sonoff 4CH Pro and Tasmota firmware as a Garage Door controller using the mcsMQTT plugin. Requirements for HomeSeer HS3 and Tasmota devices: * HomeSeer HS3 * MQTT server * A MQTT plugin for HS3 Currently there are two plugins, both free: \"MQTT\" and \"mcsMQTT\". The former is more intuitive but hasn't been updated for a while, the latter is newer and constantly updated. If you use \"MQTT\" plugin you need to synch the virtual device to reflect the status of the physical button, this can be done with a plugin: * EasyTrigger plugin - costs 25$ (used to synchronise the status of the virtual device in HomeSeer when the Sonoff Tasmota module is operated from the physical button) If you use \"mcsMQTT\", starting from ver 3.0.3+ it allows to create a device that both report and control the status of the Sonoff. More info here: https://forums.homeseer.com/showthread.php?t=192675 Tasmota Plug-in If your interested in a FREE specific plug-in for Sonoff + Tasmota, then Instructions are HERE and you can install it from the Homeseer Plug-ins Manager, in Primary Technology as TasMQTT. This plug-in takes care of two-way updates so wall switches update Homseer devices and homeseer changes update Sonoff devices. The plug-in also takes care of monitoring sonoff availability and optionally flags homeseer devices as offline so events can take that into consideration before making changes. When devices come back online Homeseer is updated with the current status of the devices. The plug-in also supports Tasmota Sensors such as the Sonoff TH1 etc. The plug-in has so far been tested extensively with the entire Sonoff Portfolio and as new devices become available we'll test those too. This plug-in has been in beta for 6 months and has now reached production. Beta's will continue to be released to support any new Tasmota enabled devices.","title":"HomeSeer"},{"location":"Homebridge/","text":"Homebridge is a NodeJS server which emulates the iOS HomeKit API to enable support for non-native devices (like Sonoff and Magichome devices). Tasmota compatible plugins have been developed by macwyznawca and arachnetech as well as others to add support for these devices in Apple's Home app and through iCloud for automation (iPad, HomePod/Apple TV 4 or newer required). Note these plugins are not necessarily specific to Sonoff devices. The homebridge-mqttthing package has support for many types of devices and is quite flexible with different options especially for RGB/RGBW LED strips. As of 1.0.11 homebridge-mqttthing supports the following Homekit device types: * Light bulb * Switch * Outlet * Motion Sensor * Occupancy Sensor * Light Sensor * Contact Sensor * Doorbell * Security System * Smoke Sensor * Temperature Sensor * Humidity Sensor * Stateless Programmable Switch * Garage Door * Garage Door Opener Check out macwyznawca's packages for supported functions, each in a separate package. To use Homebridge with Tasmota you need to have an existing MQTT broker set up ( see wiki article ) and each of your Sonoff devices should have a unique topic set.

The advantage for this change is, to avoid to double flash with the minimal and then with the normal firmware and to use more features like Webserver and SSL encryption. It was hard to find those information, I'll give credits to some users from the german CreationX Forum. Because to unsolder the flash isn't that easy as just solder in pins, this is only for advanced users . Don't forget, it's at your own risk and the device could be damaged permanently. The Hardware ~ Soldering iron Tin Tweezers The Flash ~ The origin flash block is a XTX PN25F08B 1725XDG. We exchange it with a WINBOND W25Q32FVSIG 1416. You can find the WINBOND Flash on eBay ( another ebay ) or AliExpress Those China flash memory ICs are cheap productions, means the chance to solder in a new defect not working flash block is high! Be ready to re-do the operation if the upload fails. If you want to test the flash block, build yourself a test module, something like this for easy soldering in a flash and test it before soldering it in another sonoff basics board. The Operation ~ You will notice that the LED is in the way. Get a pen and mark on of its Pin with the board, so you can solder it in back later in the correct Position. Its a Red-Green LED, if you solder it in the wrong way, it will light up in red. After the LED is out of the way, you give some tin on the pins from the flash block and connect all 4 pins in a row together with tin. This way it will be easier to desolder it, because you need to melt all pins at the same time. Now get a thin object between the flash and the board, try to gently lift the flash up and at the same time melt both rows of the flash pins tin rotatory. If you got enough space between the board and the flash change to the tweezers and finally take the flash block off. Now refresh the contacts on the board for the new flash block with a lil bit of fresh tin. Don't forget to give a lil bit tin to the new pins of the flash block, too! Now put it on the contacts on the board and try to lock it with the tweezers. Next take the solder iron and head just one pin and try to arrange the flashblock in the center now. Finally, heat and solder the other pins to the board. You can also use a hot air rework station, this would be much safer, but also more expensive ( Amazon ). Be sure to protect the rest of the board if using the heat gun! Good job, you are done :) Flashing ~ The next step is to tell Atom (i did not do it with Arduino IDE, sry) to use the whole new 4MB Flash. Note: You can only use 3MB, because 1MB is needed for SPIFFS. To do this, you need to edit the platformio.ini file. Search for your prefered language Block and copy the whole Block. Rename it to e.g. Sonoff-DE-4M Now change the following line build_flags = -Wl,-Tesp8266.flash.1m0.ld -DMY_LANGUAGE=de-DE to build_flags = -Wl,-Tesp8266.flash.4m1m.ld -DMY_LANGUAGE=de-DE Now scroll back to the top and enter a new default environment with the name of your newly created block env_default = sonoff-DE-4M You are done with the preparations, connect the Sonoff with the 4MB Flash in flash mode (hold button while powering it up), click clean, click build, click upload.

First, have a look at the excellent article from Elektor IR Remote Control Codes Decoding IR codes by hand ~ From discussion with @johan1111 on Discord. Let's suppose you have an unsupported HVAL and record the following raw IR codes using Tasmota: [3094,3062,3092,4442,576,1652,578,528,576,1650,580,528,576,528,576,1650,...] IR messages typically start with a long Mark (IR on), followed by a long Space (IR off). Here we see a double sequence of Mark (3094 \u00b5s) - Space (3062 \u00b5s) - Mark (3092 \u00b5s) - Space (4442 \u00b5s). The actual bitstream is 576,1652,578,528,576,1650,580,528,576,528,576,1650,... . You need to take timing by pairs, again the first value is Mark (IR on), the second Space (IR off). The Mark is typically of constant time, and the space will vary from short (~528 \u00b5s) for bit 0 to long (~1650 \u00b5s) for bit 1 . So the first bits of the bitstream are: 101001... Pioneer IR enconding ~ Pioneer IR encoding is very similar to NEC encoding for the bitstream. When capturing IR codes, they will easily be recognized as NEC codes. But they have subtle differences. First, the Frequency if 40KHz for Pioneer vs 38KHz for NEC. The number of IR pulses are the same, so all Pioneer timings are 5% shorter than Nec equivalent. Most Pioneer will tolerate the difference, but some won't. If you have a Pioneer device, prefer the Pioneer encoding. Second, Pioneer introduced 64 bits messages vs 32 bits for NEC. Most simple Pioneer commands still use 32 bits, but newer require 64 bits. 64 bits messages are actually sent as 2x 32 bits messages with a very short pause in between. Example, Pioneer Vol+ is 32 bits message and must be sent twice. You can either send the same message 0xA55A50AF twice with IRSend2 or send a 64 bits message with twice the same 32 payload: 0xA55A50AFA55A50AF . IRSend2 {\"Protocol\":\"PIONEER\",\"Bits\":32,\"Data\":\"0xA55A50AF\"} or IRSend {\"Protocol\":\"PIONEER\",\"Bits\":64,\"Data\":\"0xA55A50AFA55A50AF\"} Example 2: Pioneer Stereo: IRSend {\"Protocol\":\"PIONEER\",\"Bits\":64,\"Data\":\"0xA55AF906A55A03FC\"} How to convert Pioneer codes to Tasmota ~ Pioneer kindly publishes all IR Codes online on its website. Let's take a Pioneer Receiver like VSX-820. Choose the right Excel file and navigate in the corresponding tab. Pioneer codes are in short format. For example \"TV / SAT\" code is A59B+A5CD . You now need to convert these short codes into 64 bits IRRemote8266 codes. Steps: 1. Take the first byte: 0xA5 or 0b10100101 . Pioneer codes are LSB, but we need MSB. So read backwards all bits to 0b10100101 and back to hex A5 . Your first byte is A5 . Note: You can see here that 0xA5 is a palindrome. 2. Invert all bits of previous byte: 0b01011010 . Your second byte is 5A . 3. Take the second byte 0x9B or 0b10011011 . Read backwards all bits giving 0b11011001. Your third byte is D9 . 4. Invert all bits from previous byte: 0b00100110 . Your fourth byte is 26 . Do the same with the second sequence A5CD , you should find the following sequence: A55AB3CD . The final sequence is: IRSend {\"Protocol\":\"PIONEER\",\"Bits\":64,\"Data\":\"0xA55AD926A55AB3CD\"} Converting Pronto IR codes to Tasmota ~ Pronto is a very common and early format to describe raw IR codes. It is fully described in this excellent series of articles The Pronto's IR Code Format Pronto is commonly represented as a series of 4-digits HEX numbers in unsigned 16-bits format. Example, from Foxtel Vol+: Vol + 0000 0073 0000 0012 000F 000A 0006 000A 0006 0016 0006 000A 0006 0010 0006 0016 0006 0016 0006 000A 0006 000A 0006 000A 0006 0016 0006 0010 0006 0016 0006 000A 0006 0010 0006 000A 0006 000A 0006 0CA0 To convert from Pronto to IRSend by hand it requires extra work. Ignore first 0000 0073 is the IR frequency, compute as \"Frequency = 1000000/(N * .241246)\". So for 0x73 (115), this gives 36KHz. First value for IRSend is 36 . 0000 is the length of the One Time Burst. There is no one time burst 0012 - Decimal 18 is the length of the repeat burst. There are 18 bits (Burst pairs) in this code. Next pulses are measured in pulses of the IR clock, so it depends on the frequency. With 36KHz, each pulse is (1000/36) 27.7 microseconds So you need to multiply by 27.7 for Tasmota to get actual \u00b5s 000F 000A - becomes 415,277 0006 000A - becomes 166,277 And so on... In the end, it will look like: IRSend 36,415,277,166,277,... Converting Broadlink IR codes to Tasmota ~ Broadlink is another popular device to send and receive IR/RF codes. Unfortunately, it does not run ESP8266, so it cannot be Tasmotized. Broadlink codes come either in Base64 format or in Hex format. Below will use Hex format which is easier to work by hand. Example: \"Code\": \"2600700000015692171117111612171116121612161117111735173517361636161117351735173517111636161216121611171116121612163616111735173517351735173517351700053D0001554916000C4E0001554916000C4E0001564817000C4D0001564917000C4C0001564917000D050000000000000000\", \"Base64\": \"JgBwAAABVpIXERcRFhIXERYSFhIWERcRFzUXNRc2FjYWERc1FzUXNRcRFjYWEhYSFhEXERYSFhIWNhYRFzUXNRc1FzUXNRc1FwAFPQABVUkWAAxOAAFVSRYADE4AAVZIFwAMTQABVkkXAAxMAAFWSRcADQUAAAAAAAAAAA== The Broadling protocol is described here: Broadlink RM2 network protocol Here is a copy of the part specifically describing Offset Contents 0x00 0x26 = IR, 0xb2 for RF 433Mhz, 0xd7 for RF 315Mhz 0x01 repeat count, (0 = no repeat, 1 send twice, .....) 0x02-0x03 Length of the following data in little endian 0x04 .... Pulse lengths in 2^-15 s units (\u00b5s * 269 / 8192 works very well) .... 0x0d 0x05 at the end for IR only Each value is represented by one byte. If the length exceeds one byte then it is stored big endian with a leading 0. Example: The header for an Optoma projector is 8920 4450 8920 * 269 / 8192 = 0x124 4450 * 269 / 8192 = 0x92 ... which would be encoded as 0x00 0x1 0x24 0x92 in broalink format.

The actual bitstream is 576,1652,578,528,576,1650,580,528,576,528,576,1650,... . You need to take timing by pairs, again the first value is Mark (IR on), the second Space (IR off). The Mark is typically of constant time, and the space will vary from short (~528 \u00b5s) for bit 0 to long (~1650 \u00b5s) for bit 1 .

When capturing IR codes, they will easily be recognized as NEC codes. But they have subtle differences. First, the Frequency if 40KHz for Pioneer vs 38KHz for NEC. The number of IR pulses are the same, so all Pioneer timings are 5% shorter than Nec equivalent. Most Pioneer will tolerate the difference, but some won't. If you have a Pioneer device, prefer the Pioneer encoding. Second, Pioneer introduced 64 bits messages vs 32 bits for NEC. Most simple Pioneer commands still use 32 bits, but newer require 64 bits. 64 bits messages are actually sent as 2x 32 bits messages with a very short pause in between. Example, Pioneer Vol+ is 32 bits message and must be sent twice. You can either send the same message 0xA55A50AF twice with IRSend2 or send a 64 bits message with twice the same 32 payload: 0xA55A50AFA55A50AF .

You now need to convert these short codes into 64 bits IRRemote8266 codes. Steps: 1. Take the first byte: 0xA5 or 0b10100101 . Pioneer codes are LSB, but we need MSB. So read backwards all bits to 0b10100101 and back to hex A5 . Your first byte is A5 . Note: You can see here that 0xA5 is a palindrome. 2. Invert all bits of previous byte: 0b01011010 . Your second byte is 5A . 3. Take the second byte 0x9B or 0b10011011 . Read backwards all bits giving 0b11011001. Your third byte is D9 . 4. Invert all bits from previous byte: 0b00100110 .

Ignore first 0000 0073 is the IR frequency, compute as \"Frequency = 1000000/(N * .241246)\". So for 0x73 (115), this gives 36KHz. First value for IRSend is 36 . 0000 is the length of the One Time Burst. There is no one time burst 0012 - Decimal 18 is the length of the repeat burst. There are 18 bits (Burst pairs) in this code. Next pulses are measured in pulses of the IR clock, so it depends on the frequency. With 36KHz, each pulse is (1000/36) 27.7 microseconds So you need to multiply by 27.7 for Tasmota to get actual \u00b5s 000F 000A - becomes 415,277 0006 000A - becomes 166,277 And so on...

your own build . Add the following to user_config_override.h : #ifndef USE_KNX #define USE_KNX // Enable KNX IP Protocol Support (+9.4k code, +3k7 mem) #endif What is KNX? ~ The KNX IP Protocol is an international open standard for smart homes and smart buildings automation. It is a decentralized system. Each device can talk directly to each other without the need of a central controller or server. Any panel or server is just for telesupervision and for sending requests. KNX IP Protocol uses a UDP multicast on 224.0.23.12 : 3671 , so there is no need for a KNX Router unless you want to communicate to KNX Devices that are not in the WIFI Network (Twisted Pair, RF, Powerline). Each device has a physical address (like a fixed IP) as 1 . 1 . 0 and that address is used for configuration purposes. Each device can be configured with group addresses as 2 / 2 / 1 and that address can be used for sending/receiving commands. So, for example, if 2 devices that are configured with the 2 / 2 / 1 for turning on/off their outputs, and other device send Turn ON command to 2 / 2 / 1 , both devices will turn on their outputs. Integration ~ Several home automation systems have KNX support. For example, Home Assistant has a XKNX Python Library to connect to KNX devices using a KNX Router. If you don't have a KNX Router , you can use a Software KNX Router like KNXd on the same Raspberry Pi than Home Assistant. KNXd is used by Home Assistant for reading this UDP Multicast, although KNXd has other cool features that need extra hardware like connect to KNX devices by Twister Pair, Power Line or RF. If using the Home Assistant distribution called Hassio , everything for KNX is already included by default. If you use the ETS (KNX Configurator Software) you can add any TasmotaTasmota KNX as a dummy device. If the Tasmotadevice is connecting to a Wifi Repeater you might experience some issues receiving KNX Telegrams. This also applies to mDNS and Emulation features. Implemented Features ~ The implemented features, up to now, in KNX for Tasmota are: General: * buttons (just push) * relays (on/off/toggle) * lights (led strips, etc. but just on/off) Sensor lists that you can use in KNX is (only one sensor per type): * Temperature * Humidity * Energy (v, i, power) For using rules: * send KNX command (on/off) * receive KNX command (on/off) * send values by KNX (any float type, temperature for example) * receive a KNX read request Usage Examples ~ There are multiple possible configurations. Here are explained just a few as example. The options for selecting relays, buttons, sensors, etc. are only available if were configured on Configure Module Menu . To configure KNX, enter on the Configuration Menu of Tasmota and select Configure KNX. Note on KNX communication enhancement option: As Wifi Multicast communication is not reliable in some wifi router due to IGMP problems or Snooping, an enhancement was implemented. This option increase the reliability by reducing the chances of losing telegrams, sending the same telegram 3 times. In practice it works really good and it is enough for normal home use. When this option is on, Tasmota will ignore toggle commands by KNX if those are sent more than 1 toggle per second. Just 1 toggle per second is working fine. 1) Setting Several Tasmota to be controlled as one by a Home Automation System: ~ We can set one of the group address to be the same in all the devices so as to turn them on or off at the same time. In this case, so as to inform the status of all the relays to the Automation System, just one of the devices have to be configured as the responder. If you use the same Group Address for sending and receiving, you have to take into account not to make loops. DEVICE 1 DEVICE 2 2) Setting 2 Tasmota to be linked as stair lights: ~ We can set one device to send the status of its output and another to read that and follow. And the second device can send the status of its button and the first device will toggle. With this configuration we can avoid to make a loop. DEVICE 1 DEVICE 2 3) Setting a button as initiator of a scene: ~ Just setting one device to send the push of a button, and the rest just use that value to turn them on. In this case, there is no toggle. Every time the button is pushed, the turn on command is sent. DEVICE 1 DEVICE 2 4) Setting a Temperature sensor: ~ We can configure to send the value of temperature or humidity every teleperiod. This teleperiod can be configured. See TasmotaTasmota wiki . It is recommended also to set the reply temperature address. 5) Using rules: ~ More functionality can be added to Tasmota using rules. In the KNX Menu, can be set a Group Address to send data or commands by rules, as KNX TX1 to KNX TX5 In rules we can use the command KnxTx_Cmnd1 1 to send an ON state command to the group address set in KNX TX1 slot of the KNX menu. Also, we can use the command KnxTx_Val1 15 to send a 15 value to the group address set in KNX TX1 slot of the KNX menu. In the KNX Menu can be set a Group Address to receive commands by rules as KNX RX1 to KNX RX5 In rules we can use the events to catch the reception of COMMANDS from KNX to those RX Slots. Example: rule on event#knxrx_cmnd1 do var1 %value% endon to store the command received in the variable VAR1 In rules we can use the events to catch the reception of VALUES from KNX to those RX Slots. Example: rule on event#knxrx_val1 do var1 %value% endon to store the value received in the variable VAR1 Also, if a Read request is received from KNX Network, we can use that in a rule as for example: rule on event#knxrx_req1 do knxtx_val1 %var3% endon 6) Rule to send KNX Telegram with BH1750 Sensor Data: ~ If you want to send your sensor values by KNX every teleperiod time to the Group Address defined in KNX_TX1, you can use the following rule: rule1 1 rule1 on tele-BH1750#Illuminance do knxtx_val1 %value% endon If you want to send your sensor values by KNX only when it changes in a delta of 10 lx to the Group Address defined in KNX_TX1, you can use the following rule: rule1 1 rule1 on system #boot do backlog var1 0; var2 0 endon on BH1750#Illuminance>%var1% do backlog var1 %value%; knxtx_val1 %value%; var2 %value%; add1 5; sub2 5 endon on BH1750#Illuminance<%var2% do backlog var2 %value%; knxtx_val1 %value%; var1 %value%; add1 5; sub2 5 endon","title":"KNX"},{"location":"KNX/#what-is-knx","text":"The KNX IP Protocol is an international open standard for smart homes and smart buildings automation.

Tasmota uses a HSB color model, which besides other more subtile differences compared to HSL means, that the color must be desaturated to reach complete black or white. Control Range Commands and details Brightness 0..100 (percent) Dimmer , HSBColor3 : Brightness of the light Hue 0..359 (degrees) HSBColor1 : Color as an angle in the color wheel Sat 0..100 (percent) HSBColor2 : saturation of the color, 0=grey/white, 100=pure color CT 153..500 (mireds) CT : white color temperature, from 153 (Cold White) to 500(Warm White) with Commands ~ See light commands for how to control lights. Light Types ~ Switched Lights aka Relays ~ Switched or On/Off lights are controlled through Relay GPIOs. If you define multiple relays, they are controlled with Power<x> starting at x=1 . Alexa : you can use Wemo emulation, your device will appear as a switch. You can change it to a light in the Alexa app. Alexa : if you have one or multiple relays, you can use Philips Hue emulation. All devices will appear as On/Off lights, and named accordingly to FriendlyName . Note: if you have only Echo Spot 2nd generation, your light will have a dummy dimmer. Configuration (see below) Commands Power Configuration none 1 Channel - Dimmable Light ~ 1 channel lights are often white lights with On/Off controls and Dimmer. Alexa : you can use Philips Hue emulation, the light will appear as White light with Dimmer. Leading edge dimmer You can also configure a leading edge dimmer on 230V with the 1 Channel configuration. In this case you need a TRIAC and a zero-Cross detection that give a pulse with every crossing of the 0V of the sinus curve. For example: Define a COUNTER with the same number as the PWM (e.g. COUNTER1, PWM1). Set SETOPTION99 1 to enable detection of the raising edge of the zero-crossing. Connect zero-Crossing to COUNTER and PWM to PWM. Set PWMFREQUENCY 100 or 120 depending on the frequency of the main in your country. Additionally it is recommended to set LEDTABLE 0 for normal lamps or motors. Configuration (see below) Commands Power , Dimmer Options Auto Power On , PWM Channel Configuration , Gamma Correction 2 Channels - CCT Light ~ 2 channels lights are white lights with correlated color temperature (CCT) controls from Cold White (CT=153) to Warm White (CT=500). Alexa : you can use Philips Hue emulation, the light will appear as White light with Color Temperature. Control through the Alexa app is limited to the CT range 199..383 . Configuration (see below) Commands Power , Dimmer , Color , White , CT Options Auto Power On , PWM Channel Configuration , Gamma Correction , PWM CT 3 Channels - RGB Lights ~ 3 channel lights are RGB color lights. You can set color either via RGB or HSB ( not HSL ). Alexa support also allows XY color, but that is not supported through commands. Alexa : you can use Philips Hue emulation, the light will appear as Color light. Configuration (see below) Commands Power , Dimmer , Color , HSBColor Options Auto Power On , PWM Channel Configuration , Gamma Correction , Channel Remapping 4 Channels - RGBW Lights ~ 4 channel lights are RGBW, i.e. RGB light and an additional White light. White can be either Warm White or Cold White depending on the manufacturer. Alexa : you can use Philips Hue emulation, the light will appear as Color light and White light with CT control. The CT control is only present to force pure white instead of RGB white. Changin CT will have no effect.

Be careful not to burn out your light if you force all channels to be on using Color or RGB and White Split . 5 Channels - RGBCCT Lights ~ 5 channel lights are RGBCCT - a 3 channel RGB light and an additional 2 channel CCT light. Alexa : you can use Philips Hue emulation, the light will appear as Color light and White light with CT control. Configuration (see below) Commands Power , Dimmer , Color , HSBColor , White , CT Options Auto Power On , PWM Channel Configuration , Gamma Correction , Channel Remapping , White Blend Mode , RGB and White Split Danger Some lights have limited power supply that do not allow all channels to be at full power at the same time. Be careful not to burn out your light if you force all channels via Color or RGB and White Split Independent PWM Channels ~ Any combination of Relays and PWMs, when enabling SetOption68 1 . Splits off the light into individually controlled Channels (Useful when connecting multiple 1 channel strips to a single controller) Configuration (see below) Commands Power , Channel , Color Options Auto Power On , PWM Channel Configuration , Gamma Correction Light Options ~ Gamma Correction ~ Gamma Correction is enabled by default in Tasmota ( LedTable 1 ). Human eye perception of brightness is non linear, bringing back linearity needs a trick called Gamma Correction . Some lights have hardware gamma correction (f.e. Sonoff B1)., in which case software gamma correction should be disabled with LedTable 0 . The curve used: orange=ideal, blue=tasmota. How do I know if I have hardware gamma correction? If you find your light very dark even with Dimmer 40 , it can mean either you have hardware PWM, disable it with LedTable 0 , or you need to apply a minimum PWM value, use DimmerRange 40,100 (adapt to the best value). Internally Tasmota uses 10 bits resolution PWM to get smoother levels at low brightness. White Blend Mode ~ White Blend Mode mixes in the white channel with RGB colors while controlling the RGB light which results in a better and brighter color output. It is used only with 4 channel (RGBW) and 5 channel (RGBCCT) lights. Enable it with SetOption105 1 . For Tasmota versions before 8.5 use command RGBWWTable 255,255,255,0 instead. Calibration (optional) Generally white LEDs are brighter than RGB LEDs. If you want to keep the same brightness, you need to calibrate the white level. In this mode, any white component will be removed from RGB LEDs and sent to the white LEDs. This makes whites look much better.

Turning on CT lights turns off RGB lights and vice versa). Use SetOption37 128 to split RGB and White into 2 independent lights. If you are already using Channel Remapping, just add 128 to the value of SetOption37 . Channel Remapping ~ SetOption37 Read More Disable Auto Power On ~ Lights are always powered on when a light command or a webUI slider is used and automatically powered off when color is set to black or Dimmer is set to 0 . When enabling SetOption20 1 any change to webUI sliders or using commands CT , Dimmer , HSBColor3 , Color or Channel will not automatically power on the light if it is off. PWM CT ~ Module 48 or SetOption92 1 Some CCT lights use PWM1 for brightness and PWM2 for color temperature (instead of PWM1 for Cold White and PWM2 for Warm White). For these lights, use Module 48 aka Philips Xiaomi mode, or SetOption92 1 (supported since v.8.2.0.5) Virtual CT ~ this feature is experimental and will probably not give brilliant results Used with 4 channel RGBW lights to simulate the missing white channel (cold or warm) using RGB channels. Enable Virtual CT with SetOption 106 1 then choose which type of white you're simulating with SetOption 107 where 0 is warm white and 1 is cold white Light Categories ~ Lights come in various shapes (bulb, strips, ceiling lights, ...) but in Tasmota they are separated in 3 categories: Channel Controlled LEDs Addressable LEDs Status LEDs Channel Controlled Lights ~ PWM Lights Lights controlled using up to 5 channels (red, green, blue, cold white, warm white). Channels are controlled using PWM or APDM. PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is the most common method of controlling LED lights. These lights are configured by assigning PWM1(i) through PWM5(i) components to their GPIOs; PWM<x>i means PWM is inverted. Depending on the number of used PWMs Tasmota will recognize the light as Channels PWM1 PWM2 PWM3 PWM4 PWM5 1 Brightness 2 Cold White Warm White 3 Red Green Blue 4 Red Green Blue White 5 Red Green Blue Cold White Warm White MY92xx MY92xx family of drivers uses Adaptive Pulse Density Modulation. Configured in Tasmota by assigning MY92x1 DI and MY92x DCKI components to their GPIOs (some devices might have more than one MY92xx controller) Channel mapping for such devices is dependent on the controllers but is easily remapped using SetOption37 . SM16716 SM16716 LEDs, sometimes mislabelled as WS2801. Configured in Tasmota by assigning SM16716 CLK , SM16716 DAT and SM16716 PWR component to their GPIOs. Some SM16716 bulbs have BGR order and need SetOption37 54 to work properly. PWM Dimmer Switches ~ Specific module (requires a custom binary) for Martin Jerry/acenx/Tessan/NTONPOWER SD0x PWM dimmer switches. Brightness of the load for these dimmers is controlled by a PWM GPIO pin. They typically have power, up and down buttons, a power status LED, five brightness LEDs and another status LED. Read more... Addressable LEDs ~ Lights where each LED is individually controlled. In these lights it is possible to adjust each LEDs power, color and brightness, all just with the use of a single GPIO pin. WebUI shows hue, saturation and brightness sliders and power toggle for these lights. Red and green color may be mixed up (observed for clone of Wemos RGB shield using Tasmota 8.1.0). WS2812 Any light using WS2811, WS2812b, WS2813 or SK6812 LEDs falls into this component. They're also commonly called Neopixel lights. Configured in Tasmota by assigning WS2812 (7) component to its GPIO. For wiring, see instructions for LED strip or Wemos RGB shield . Status LEDs ~ Status LEDs are the LEDs on the device used to display device information Those LEDs are defined in a template or module using Led1 , Led2 , Led3 or Led4 (or Led1i , Led2i , Led3i or Led4i ) and additionally using LedLink or LedLinki ( LedLink was introduced in version 6.5.0.12). It is not recommended to assign Led<x> and Led<x>i with the same <x> number. Prior to version 6.5.0.12, Tasmota only supported up to two LED components to indicate the power state of the relay(s), and the Wi-Fi/MQTT connectivity status. It is possible to wire in your own LED and assign it as any of the above mentioned but that's outside the scope of this article If only one LED is configured, it serves both purposes; the link status LED and/or the LED that indicates the power state of the relay(s). If more than one LED component is defined, Led1 / Led1i will act as the Wi-Fi/MQTT status LED and the next defined LED (e.g., Led2 / Led2i ) will act as the LED that indicates the power state of the relay(s). This is the default behavior . Configuring a GPIO as an LEDLink / LEDLinki component changes this behavior. For example, on a Sonoff Basic the green LED is used as the link status LED. Once the device connects, the LED is used to indicate the relay's power status. Link status LED Link status LED shows the network state, more specifically the Wi-Fi and MQTT connection status. It blinks if the device is not connected to your Wi-Fi AP and MQTT broker (if MQTT is enabled). You can change this behaviour with LedState or turn it off with SetOption31 . Power status LED Power status LED shows the power status of relay component(s). LedMask determines which relay(s) are associated with the power status LED. This behavior can be modified with the LedState command. The LED is turned off by default when the relay is OFF and turned on when the relay switches ON. Note Depending on the device design, some LEDs are connected to the same GPIO as the relay. Those cannot be independently controlled since they have to follow the relay state. If you have more than one LED wired independently and you want it to show the power state of the relay, you must assign an LedLink GPIO. PWM LED Mode Using LedPwmMode you can change the LED display mode from simple on/off to a PWM controlled LED which will enable you to f.e. display a brighter LED when the relay is on and a dimmer LED when its OFF so you can locate the switch in the dark but not have it obnoxiously bright. LedPwmOff and LedPwmOn control the preset LED brightness in their respective states. LedPower Command When you use LedPower you take over control of that particular LED and it stops being linked to its corresponding relay and being its power status LED. Using LedLink LedLink / LedLinki is used to assign the link status LED. If your device does not have an LED for link status (or you want to use that LED for a different purpose), you can assign LedLink to an available free GPIO. When LedLink(i) is assigned, other LEDs are automatically linked to their corresponding relay and serve as that relay's power status LED - i.e., Led<x>(i) links to Relay<x>(i)","title":"Lights"},{"location":"Lights/#control-lights","text":"","title":"Control Lights"},{"location":"Lights/#with-webui","text":"Tasmota webUI displays Brightness , CT , White , Color Picker , Color Saturation or PWM Level sliders depending on the light component, the number of PWM channels configured and SetOptions used.

The MCP23017 has 16 IO pins which the MCP230xx driver uses as D0 - D15. This is visualized in the circuit diagram below but it's important to note that the MCP23017 actually differentiates between PORTA (being A0 to A7) and PORTB (being B0 to B7) - The MCP230xx driver combines the two ports in sequence to translate to pins represented as D0 through D15 for the MCP23017. The chip can be connected quite easily, especially if you can source the DIP version of the chip. Here's a basic outline of what a typical circuit would require to be functional: You will need to pick an I2C address in either of the above scenario's using the address mapping according to pin A0, A1, and A2 as from the datasheet as follows: You will need to define the address you are using in user_config_override.h for the driver to know on which address the MCP23008/MCP23017 is expected to be found. #define USE_MCP230xx_ADDR 0x20 The MCP23008/MCP23017 chips allow for both INPUT and OUTPUT - Most of the functionality of the driver is focused on INPUT mode - especially since they allow interrupt reporting and are 5V tolerant. OUTPUT functionality is however available as pinmode 5 (Documented later in this Wiki) as an additional option for those who want to use the OUTPUT functionality using the Sensor29 command which consumes ~1Kbyte of flash. The driver is disabled by default in the Tasmota firmware so the only way to gain its use would be to perform a manual compilation of your own firmware. There are three different levels in which functionality may be enabled, in the following order, by adding these lines in user_config_override.h : #define USE_MCP230xx // Enable INPUT mode (pinmode 1 through 4) #define USE_MCP230xx_OUTPUT // Enable OUTPUT mode (pinmode 5) #define USE_MCP230xx_DISPLAYOUTPUT // Display state of OUTPUT pins on main Tasmota web interface The ESP8266 will automatically detect whether you have connected an MCP23008 (8 input) or MCP23017 (16 input) and will provide telemetry data in accordance with how the device was configured from within the Tasmota firmware. If OUTPUT is enabled, telemetry data for the current state of OUTPUT pins will also be provided by telemetry. MCP23008 / MCP23017 Pin numbers in Tasmota compared to datasheets ~ The table below outlines how the pins of the MCP23008/MCP23017 are assigned: Usage of the driver ~ The MCP230xx chip (or breakout board) must be connected to the ESP8266 and the I2C pins must be configured for the module similar to the following: One that is complete you may want to confirm that the Tasmota firmware is finding your MCP23008/MCP23017 chip by sending the command through serial or MQTT: I2Cscan You should see a response giving you an address within the range of the MCP23008/MCP23017 chip (0x20 through 0x27) which may look as follows MQT: stat/tasmota/RESULT = {\"I2CScan\":\"Device(s) found at 0x20\"} If the extender is not detected, check your wiring and pin configuration. The configuration of MCP23008/MCP23017 by using Sensor29 commands via the Console or MQTT messages. In order to use the MCP23008/MCP23017, add the following two lines in your user_config_override.h as the MCP chip support is not enabled by default. #define USE_MCP230xx #define USE_MCP230xx_ADDR 0x20 The MCP23008/MCP23017 supports I 2 C address range of 0x20 through 0x27. Take care that you are not using an address which is already used by another device (e.g., 0x27 is a known address for some I 2 C Liquid Crystal Displays). Device Configuration ~ The behavior of all pins on the MCP23008/MCP23017 can be reset to a specific setting/mode globally to simplify the initial configuration as follows Command Parameters Sensor29 MCP23008 / MCP23017 I 2 C GPIO Expander configuration Reset<x> = reset all pins x = 1..6 1 = INPUT mode, no reporting, no pull-up 2 = INPUT mode, report on CHANGE, pull-up enabled 3 = INPUT mode, report on LOW, pull-up enabled 4 = INPUT mode, report on HIGH, pull-up enabled 5 = OUTPUT mode (if enabled by #define USE_MCP230xx_OUTPUT ) 6 = inverted OUTPUT mode (if enabled by #define USE_MCP230xx_OUTPUT ) pin,pinmode{,intpullup|outstate{,repmode}} pin = the I/O pin on the MCP230xx chip 0..7 for MCP23008 0..15 for the MCP23017) pinmode = operational mode of the pin ( ?, 0..5 ) ? = query pin configuration 0 = Disabled (deprecated, but will be default for previously unconfigured devices) 1 = INPUT (Floating - only telemetry data will be sent according to configuration TelePeriod intervals) 2 = INPUT with INTERRUPT on CHANGE (will send an MQTT output on state change from LOW to HIGH and HIGH to LOW) 3 = INPUT with INTERRUPT on CHANGE to LOW (will send an MQTT output on state change only from HIGH to LOW) 4 = INPUT with INTERRUPT on CHANGE to HIGH (will send an MQTT output on state change only from LOW to HIGH) 5 = OUTPUT (if enabled with #define USE_MCP230xx_OUTPUT ) 6 = inverted OUTPUT (if enabled with #define USE_MCP230xx_OUTPUT ) intpullup (pinmode 1..4 ) . Pull-up resistors are disabled by default for pin mode 1 whilst enabled by default for pin modes 2..4 (because they are interrupt enabled pins and we do not want signal bounce). The internal pull-up on these pins may be disabled if necessary if you are biasing them externally. 0 = weak internal pull-up disabled (default for pinmode 1 ) 1 = weak internal pull-up enabled (default for pinmode 2..4 ) outstate (pinmode 5..6 ) = set the default state of an OUTPUT pin on reset/power-up. If your device is configured to save state ( SetOption0 = 1 ), the outstate setting will be ignored and the last known state of the pin will be applied during power-up/reset. 0/off = set output pin to OFF 1/on = set output pin state to ON 2/toggle = toggle output pin state repmode = reporting mode (optional). Applicable only for pinmode 2..4 . Reporting mode is disabled for pinmode 1 and for output pinmodes ( 5..6 ) 0 = interrupt using Event and report using telemetry (default) 1 = interrupt using Event only (no telemetry reported) 2 = report using telemetry only (no Event triggered) Examples: Sensor29 Reset1 MQT: stat/tasmota/RESULT = {\"Sensor29_D99\":{\"MODE\":1,\"PULL_UP\":\"OFF\",\"INT_MODE\":\"DISABLED\",\"STATE\":\"\"}} Pin and State is reported as 99 because it is set across all pins. Mode should correspond with the reset pinmode option used. Sensor29 0,? MQT: stat/tasmota/RESULT = {\"Sensor29_D0\":{\"MODE\":1,\"PULL_UP\":\"OFF\",\"INT_MODE\":\"DISABLED\",\"STATE\":\"ON\"}} Confirming that the pin is in pinmode 1 and that the pull-up resistor is not enabled. INT_MODE indicates the interrupt mode for pins which are interrupt enabled (pinmode 2 through 4) - In the example above it is disabled for pin mode 1 (INPUT without INTERRUPT) The current STATE of the pin as ON or OFF is reported as at the time the command is issued is also reported. IMPORTANT NOTICE ON USE OF INTERRUPTS ~ Only use interrupts on pins which are either explicitly pulled down GND or up to VCC externally as floating pins may cause unintended MQTT responses for pins which are floating. So unless your connected wire/device explicitly pulls the pin to GND or VCC only when conditions of an interrupt would be met it is recommended that you either do not set a pin for an interrupt mode or at least enable pull-up resistors for the unused pins with pullup = 1 when you perform your sensor29 pin,pinmode,pullup command. Examples of some pin configuration options: sensor29 4,1,0 - Will enable D4 for INPUT without internal pull-up resistor sensor29 3,1,1 - Will enable D3 for INPUT with the internal pull-up resistor ENABLED sensor29 5,2,1 - Will enable D5 for INPUT and report on change state from LOW to HIGH and HIGH to LOW via MQTT sensor29 6,3,1 - Will enable D6 for INPUT and report on change state from HIGH to LOW (note pull-up is also enabled) sensor29 2,4,0 - Will enable D2 for INPUT and report on change state from LOW to HIGH (note pull-up is not enabled) Pull-up resistor support is valid for all modes from 1 through 4 Default telemetry logging will occur for all pins as per the configured logging interval of the ESP8266 as configured in the Tasmota firmware options. The telemetry logging will push out to log and MQTT a JSON as follows: tele/tasmota/SENSOR = {\"Time\":\"2018-08-18T16:13:47\",\"MCP230XX\": \"D0\":0,\"D1\":0,\"D2\":1,\"D3\":0,\"D4\":0,\"D5\":0,\"D6\":0,\"D7\":1}} Again, this will depend on whether an MCP23008 or MCP23017 is used insofar that the number of pins/bits reported will be 8 (0 to 7) or 16 (0 to 15) respectively. INTERRUPT MODES AND USAGE ~ Interrupts will report for individual pins as and when the conditions which were configured are met and will look something like this: Interrupt message on HIGH for input pin 0 MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"Time\" : \"2018-08-19T16:04:50\" , \"MCP230XX_INT\" :{ \"D0\" : 1 , \"MS\" : 301 }} Interrupt message on LOW for input pin 1 MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"Time\" : \"2018-08-19T16:04:50\" , \"MCP230XX_INT\" :{ \"D1\" : 0 , \"MS\" : 519 }} The state of the pin captured during the interrupt is reported as Dx=y where x is the pin number and y is the state of the pin. In addition the number of milliseconds since the last interrupt occurred for the particular pin is also reported as MS=xx where xx is the number of milliseconds recorded. In addition to the MQTT message the driver will also execute an event command in the following format: event MCPINT_Dxx=y Where xx = the pin number from 0 through 7 (MCP23008) or 0 through 15 (MCP23017) and y the state of the pin as it was captured by the interrupt register of the MCP23008/MCP23017 chip. The complete output for an interrupt enabled pin would look like this: MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"Time\" : \"2018-08-19T16:08:28\" , \"MCP230XX_INT\" :{ \"D0\" : 0 , \"MS\" : 217353 }} SRC : Rule RSL : Group 0 , Index 1 , Command EVENT , Data MCPINT_D0 = 0 MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"Event\" : \"Done\" } MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"Time\" : \"2018-08-19T16:08:46\" , \"MCP230XX_INT\" :{ \"D0\" : 1 , \"MS\" : 18101 }} SRC : Rule RSL : Group 0 , Index 1 , Command EVENT , Data MCPINT_D0 = 1 MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"Event\" : \"Done\" } The latter makes it possible to integrate interrupt responses with rules for example: rule on event#MCPINT_D0=1 do power on endon on event#MCPINT_D0=0 do power off endon In the example above the rule would respond to an interrupt of HIGH on pin 0 of the MCP by executing command \"power on\" and respond to an interrupt of LOW on pin 0 with the command \"power off\" See the Wiki on Using Rules for more information on how this can be helpful to your requirements. If you require only one of the two reporting methods you may use the sensor29 command to configure the interrupt behavior according to your requirements using command: sensor29 pin,pinmode,pullup,intmode The intmode parameter is optional for pin modes 2 through 4 (those that support interrupts) and may be configured according to the table below depending on your requirements: Keep in mind that the MCP23008/MCP23017 chip will only store the last interrupt registered in the interrupt register and capture register - Because the interrupt register is only checked every 50 milliseconds by the Tasmota firmware you may experience missed interrupts if your incoming signals fluctuate/change faster than 20 times per second. HOME ASSISTANT TIPS ~ You can use SetOption59 1 in order to get extra SENSOR status telemetry messages in addition to event-triggered RESULT messages. This allows very good integration with Home Assistant because it needs to monitor only one payload for both periodic and instant messages using binary_sensor : - platform : mqtt name : \"MCP23017 Teszt D0 SENSOR\" state_topic : \"tele/tasmota/SENSOR\" value_template : \"{{ value_json['MCP230XX'].D0 }}\" payload_on : \"1\" payload_off : \"0\" availability_topic : \"tele/tasmota/LWT\" payload_available : \"Online\" payload_not_available : \"Offline\" qos : 0 device_class : door ADVANCED FUNCTIONS ~ Several advanced functions have been added to extend the flexibility and interoperability of the MCP23008/MCP23017 with specific focus on adding functionality which is not present on the hardware's built-in GPIO pins and offloading some of the functionality that would normally be performed by rules or counters on the Tasmota device into the driver of the MCP23008/MCP23017. These include the following * INTPRI - Interrupt Priority, being able to control the rate at which the MCP23008/MCP23017 is polled to see if any interrupts has occurred since the previous poll. * INTDEF - Interrupt Deffer, being able to control the number of interrupts that are ignored on a specific pin before reporting would occur via telemetry and/or EVENT. * INTTIMER - Interrupt Timer which allows for time based counter reporting, specifically reporting the number of times an interrupt has occurred on interrupt enabled pins. * INTCNT - Works with INTTIMER to enable/disable counting for a specific pin. * INTRETAIN - Keep track of whether an interrupt occurred or not and defer reporting to next telemetry message. The above additions are described in further detail below. ADVANCED FUNCTION #1 - INTERRUPT PRIORITY (INTPRI) ~ The maximum interrupt polling rate is once per approximately 50 milliseconds - This is what the Tasmota firmware allows as a maximum and how it is configured in the MCP23008/MCP23017 driver by default. If you want to reduce the number of interrupt polls per second you may use the INTPRI command parameter as follows: sensor29 intpri Will give you the current setting via JSON response as follows: MQT: stat/tasmota/RESULT = {\"MCP230xx_INTPRI\":{\"D_99\":0}} To change the value you may use command as follows: sensor29 intpri,x Where x is the number of 50ms cycles (between 0 and 20) which will be skipped before the MCP23008/MCP23017 chip is polled for interrupt. The last interrupt recorded by the MCP23008/MCP23017 will be reported via the configured method. For example, lets assume you only want the interrupt polling to occur every 500ms (i.e. twice per second) you could do command: sensor29 intpri,10 // interrupt polled every 10*50 milliseconds, approximated ADVANCED FUNCTION #2 - INTERRUPT DEFER (INTDEF) ~ This setting is useful if you need to defer the reporting of an interrupt by event or telemetry until it has occurred at least X number of times. Syntax: sensor29 intdef,pin // Will provide current setting of pin sensor29 intdef,pin,x // Will set new deffer value to x (0-15) Examples: sensor29 intdef,pin,5 // Will only report interrupt when it occurs 5 times sensor29 intdef,pin,10 // Will only report interrupt when it has occured 10 times Interrupts occurring a number of times prior to the setting will be counted but ignored for reporting purposes. ADVANCED FUNCTION #3 - INTERRUPT TIMER (INTTIMER) ~ This function is used in conjunction with INTCOUNT (Documented below) It allows a timer to be configured over which period the number of interrupts will be counted. Syntax: sensor29 inttimer // Will provide the current amount of seconds for timer sensor29 inttimer,x // Allows setting number of seconds (x) for timer interval ADVANCED FUNCTION #4 - INTERRUPT COUNTER ENABLE (INTCNT) ~ Enable interrupt counting for a particular pin. This functionality works in conjunction with INTTIMER (Documented above) Syntax: sensor29 intcnt,pin // Readback current setting of interrupt counting for pin (0=OFF/1=ON) sensor29 intcnt,pin,x // Enable/Disable interrupt counting for pin (x=0=OFF,x=1=ON) Use case example could be if you want to count the number of times an interrupt occurred on a D0 over a period of 60 seconds. For this we will need the following: sensor29 inttimer,60 // Enable interrupt timer for 60 second interval sensor29 intcnt,0,1 // Enable interrupt counter for pin D0 The above will result in the number of interrupts that occur within the 60 second period configured to be counted and then reported via telemetry at the end of the 60 second time. A use case for this would be to determine the RPM of something, or perhaps the number of pulses received from an energy meter within a 60 second period to determine energy usage on a per minute bases... or wind speed from impulses received from an anemometer. ADVANCED FUNCTION #5 - INTERRUPT RETAIN (INTRETAIN) ~ This functionality disables immediate even and/or telemetry reporting for a specific pin that has been configured for any of the interrupt modes listed above. If this is enabled for a particular pin and the pin has an interrupt mode configured the fact that an interrupt condition was met will be remembered (but not reported immediately) and will be reported in a MQTT message when the next telemetry period occurs in the following format: {\"Time\":\"2018-12-06T23:59:26\",\"MCP_INTRETAIN\": {\"D0\":1,\"D1\":0,\"D2\":1,\"D3\":1,\"D4\":0,\"Value\":13}} In the example above it means that an interrupt occurred at some point during the previous telemetry period for pins D0, D2, and D3 as indicated by the 1's present for each pin - Pins with a value of 0 means that although the pin was configured for interrupt retain that no interrupt occurred during the previous telemetry period for that particular pin. For the sake of handling bit-wise operations within your home automation software the decimal value of the respective bits are also aggregated into the Value output included in the telemetry message. Syntax: sensor29 intretain,pin // Readback current setting of interrupt retain for a pin (0=OFF/1=ON) sensor29 intretain,pin,x // Enable/Disable interrupt counting for pin (x=0=OFF,x=1=ON) OUTPUT FUNCTIONS (PIN MODES 5 AND 6) ~ Enable OUTPUT support by removing the comment (#) for the following compiler directive to your user_config_override.h #define USE_MCP230xx_OUTPUT This will extend the sensor29 command enabling pinmode 5 and 6 (inverted) for output, for example: sensor29 0,5,0 // Configure pin 0 as OUTPUT and default to OFF on reset/power-up sensor29 0,5,1 // Configure pin 0 as OUTPUT and default to ON on reset/power-up sensor29 0,6,0 // Configure pin 0 as INVERTED OUTPUT and default to ON on reset/power-up sensor29 0,6,1 // Configure pin 0 as INVERTED OUTPUT and default to OFF on reset/power-up Confirmation will be sent using MQT, for example: MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"Sensor29_D2\" :{ \"MODE\" : 5 , \"PULL_UP\" : \"OFF\" , \"INT_MODE\" : \"DISABLED\" , \"STATE\" : \"OFF\" }} The only difference between pinmode 5 and pinmode 6 is that pinmode 5 will result in normal output state, i.e. pin will be LOW when OFF whereas pinmode 6 will cause the pin to be HIGH when OFF. This is useful when using relays which have inverted inputs. If SAVE_STATE / setoption0 is enabled in your firmware configuration then the last known state of the pin will be used on power-up/reset thereby ignoring the pull-up parameter in the commands above. To change the state of an output pin you may use: sensor29 0,ON // Turn pin ON (HIGH if pinmode 5 or LOW if pinmode 6(inverted)) sensor29 0,OFF // Turn pin OFF (LOW if pinmode 5 or HIGH if pinmode 6(inverted)) sensor29 0,T // Toggle the current state of pin from ON to OFF, or OFF to ON Additionally all OUTPUT pins will be exposed as RELAYS and ordered behind the normal GPIO based RELAYS. Instead of the above sensor command you can also use the POWERxx command like for any RELAY. If you define INTERLOCK and/or INTERLOCK groups these will also take care about the out pins. The numbering of the RELAY's is following the standard tasmota behavior. Counting from D0 any defined OUT pin will add a new RELAY. Example: D0, D2, D3, D7 are out pins, then D0=POWER1, D2=POWER2, D3=POWER3 and D7=POWER4. Same behavior you can expect when defining PULSETIME for RELAYS. Telemetry response will be provided accordingly, for example: MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"S29cmnd_D0\" :{ \"COMMAND\" : \"ON\" , \"STATE\" : \"ON\" }} MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"S29cmnd_D0\" :{ \"COMMAND\" : \"OFF\" , \"STATE\" : \"OFF\" }} MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"S29cmnd_D0\" :{ \"COMMAND\" : \"TOGGLE\" , \"STATE\" : \"ON\" }} COMMAND = Command which was sent STATE = New state after execution of command Telemetry data is provided for pins which are enabled for output. For example, if pin 0 was enabled for OUTPUT the following additional telemetry message will be sent by MQTT at the same time as the normal telemetry interval occurs which reports the current states of pins. Additionally you can also use the standard POWERxx reporting. MQT : tele /tasmota/ SENSOR = { \"Time\" : \"2018-08-18T16:41:20\" , \"MCP230XX\" :{ \"D0\" : 0 , \"D1\" : 0 , \"D2\" : 1 , \"D3\" : 0 , \"D4\" : 0 , \"D5\" : 0 , \"D6\" : 0 , \"D7\" : 0 }, \"MCP230_OUT\" : { \"OUT_D4\" : \"OFF\" , \"END\" : 1 }} Note the MCP230XX telemetry which provides the current logic state of all the pins and then the second MQT telemetry as MCP230_OUT which indicates the current state of pins configured for OUTPUT - In this case pin 4 or D4 Remember to adhere to the current limitations of OUTPUT pins when using the device for switching external devices such as LED's. That being said most readily available relay pc boards available from vendors are optically isolated from the input so these will work perfectly.","title":"MCP23008 / MCP23017 GPIO Expander"},{"location":"MCP230xx/#mcp23008-mcp23017-gpio-expander","text":"Technical Data from the manufacturer: * Microchip MCP23008 * Microchip MCP23017 Generally available breakout boards for the MCP23017 look similar to this: The MCP23008 has 8 IO pins which the MCP230xx driver uses as D0 - D7. The MCP23017 has 16 IO pins which the MCP230xx driver uses as D0 - D15. This is visualized in the circuit diagram below but it's important to note that the MCP23017 actually differentiates between PORTA (being A0 to A7) and PORTB (being B0 to B7) - The MCP230xx driver combines the two ports in sequence to translate to pins represented as D0 through D15 for the MCP23017. The chip can be connected quite easily, especially if you can source the DIP version of the chip. Here's a basic outline of what a typical circuit would require to be functional: You will need to pick an I2C address in either of the above scenario's using the address mapping according to pin A0, A1, and A2 as from the datasheet as follows: You will need to define the address you are using in user_config_override.h for the driver to know on which address the MCP23008/MCP23017 is expected to be found. #define USE_MCP230xx_ADDR 0x20 The MCP23008/MCP23017 chips allow for both INPUT and OUTPUT - Most of the functionality of the driver is focused on INPUT mode - especially since they allow interrupt reporting and are 5V tolerant. OUTPUT functionality is however available as pinmode 5 (Documented later in this Wiki) as an additional option for those who want to use the OUTPUT functionality using the Sensor29 command which consumes ~1Kbyte of flash. The driver is disabled by default in the Tasmota firmware so the only way to gain its use would be to perform a manual compilation of your own firmware. There are three different levels in which functionality may be enabled, in the following order, by adding these lines in user_config_override.h : #define USE_MCP230xx // Enable INPUT mode (pinmode 1 through 4) #define USE_MCP230xx_OUTPUT // Enable OUTPUT mode (pinmode 5) #define USE_MCP230xx_DISPLAYOUTPUT // Display state of OUTPUT pins on main Tasmota web interface The ESP8266 will automatically detect whether you have connected an MCP23008 (8 input) or MCP23017 (16 input) and will provide telemetry data in accordance with how the device was configured from within the Tasmota firmware.

Syntax: sensor29 intretain,pin // Readback current setting of interrupt retain for a pin (0=OFF/1=ON) sensor29 intretain,pin,x // Enable/Disable interrupt counting for pin (x=0=OFF,x=1=ON)","title":"ADVANCED FUNCTION #5 - INTERRUPT RETAIN (INTRETAIN)"},{"location":"MCP230xx/#output-functions-pin-modes-5-and-6","text":"Enable OUTPUT support by removing the comment (#) for the following compiler directive to your user_config_override.h #define USE_MCP230xx_OUTPUT This will extend the sensor29 command enabling pinmode 5 and 6 (inverted) for output, for example: sensor29 0,5,0 // Configure pin 0 as OUTPUT and default to OFF on reset/power-up sensor29 0,5,1 // Configure pin 0 as OUTPUT and default to ON on reset/power-up sensor29 0,6,0 // Configure pin 0 as INVERTED OUTPUT and default to ON on reset/power-up sensor29 0,6,1 // Configure pin 0 as INVERTED OUTPUT and default to OFF on reset/power-up Confirmation will be sent using MQT, for example: MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"Sensor29_D2\" :{ \"MODE\" : 5 , \"PULL_UP\" : \"OFF\" , \"INT_MODE\" : \"DISABLED\" , \"STATE\" : \"OFF\" }} The only difference between pinmode 5 and pinmode 6 is that pinmode 5 will result in normal output state, i.e. pin will be LOW when OFF whereas pinmode 6 will cause the pin to be HIGH when OFF. This is useful when using relays which have inverted inputs. If SAVE_STATE / setoption0 is enabled in your firmware configuration then the last known state of the pin will be used on power-up/reset thereby ignoring the pull-up parameter in the commands above. To change the state of an output pin you may use: sensor29 0,ON // Turn pin ON (HIGH if pinmode 5 or LOW if pinmode 6(inverted)) sensor29 0,OFF // Turn pin OFF (LOW if pinmode 5 or HIGH if pinmode 6(inverted)) sensor29 0,T // Toggle the current state of pin from ON to OFF, or OFF to ON Additionally all OUTPUT pins will be exposed as RELAYS and ordered behind the normal GPIO based RELAYS. Instead of the above sensor command you can also use the POWERxx command like for any RELAY. If you define INTERLOCK and/or INTERLOCK groups these will also take care about the out pins. The numbering of the RELAY's is following the standard tasmota behavior. Counting from D0 any defined OUT pin will add a new RELAY. Example: D0, D2, D3, D7 are out pins, then D0=POWER1, D2=POWER2, D3=POWER3 and D7=POWER4. Same behavior you can expect when defining PULSETIME for RELAYS. Telemetry response will be provided accordingly, for example: MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"S29cmnd_D0\" :{ \"COMMAND\" : \"ON\" , \"STATE\" : \"ON\" }} MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"S29cmnd_D0\" :{ \"COMMAND\" : \"OFF\" , \"STATE\" : \"OFF\" }} MQT : stat /tasmota/ RESULT = { \"S29cmnd_D0\" :{ \"COMMAND\" : \"TOGGLE\" , \"STATE\" : \"ON\" }} COMMAND = Command which was sent STATE = New state after execution of command Telemetry data is provided for pins which are enabled for output. For example, if pin 0 was enabled for OUTPUT the following additional telemetry message will be sent by MQTT at the same time as the normal telemetry interval occurs which reports the current states of pins. Additionally you can also use the standard POWERxx reporting. MQT : tele /tasmota/ SENSOR = { \"Time\" : \"2018-08-18T16:41:20\" , \"MCP230XX\" :{ \"D0\" : 0 , \"D1\" : 0 , \"D2\" : 1 , \"D3\" : 0 , \"D4\" : 0 , \"D5\" : 0 , \"D6\" : 0 , \"D7\" : 0 }, \"MCP230_OUT\" : { \"OUT_D4\" : \"OFF\" , \"END\" : 1 }} Note the MCP230XX telemetry which provides the current logic state of all the pins and then the second MQT telemetry as MCP230_OUT which indicates the current state of pins configured for OUTPUT - In this case pin 4 or D4 Remember to adhere to the current limitations of OUTPUT pins when using the device for switching external devices such as LED's. That being said most readily available relay pc boards available from vendors are optically isolated from the input so these will work perfectly.","title":"OUTPUT FUNCTIONS (PIN MODES 5 AND 6)"},{"location":"MCP9808/","text":"This feature is not included in precompiled binaries To use it you must compile your build .

Data is only published, when z is in the upper half (z values are between 0 and 511). Location sensing in active volume: near the surface you can move your finger without producing location data, i.e. to change the mode. at the moment the circle gestures ((COUNTER)CLOCKWISE) must be activated with the COMMAND: SENSOR91 1 (we must wait 250 ms after the start and can not activate it in the init function, this might differ depending on the board firmware) COMMANDS: ~ SENSOR36 0 - next mode SENSOR36 1 - gesture mode SENSOR36 2 - airwheel mode SENSOR36 3 - position mode (ATTENTION: this will send a lot of data!) MQTT-messages: ~ The terminology follows the documentation from MICROCHIP, but is shortened to save space especially for RULES. The board is to be viewed like a map, where UP is NORTH and RIGHT is EAST an so on. The big central part of the surface is CENTRE. A movement (FLICK) from LEFT to RIGHT is translated to FLICK-WEST-EAST and then finally shortened to {FL_WE:1}. If you only do a flick at the left edge (with a short movement to the right) this will be EDGE-FLICK-WEST-EAST and then in the final message: {E_FL_WE:1}. A TOUCH (leaving your finger on the board) reports the location and the duration (in counts of 50ms). So touching the centre for a second, publishes messages from {TH_C:1} up to (approx.) {TH_C:20}. Touching for less than 1,25 seconds triggers a TAP-message in the moment of leaving the surface, so on the lower edge we will see: {TP_S:1} (plus some {TH_S:1...x} for the contact duration). Double Tap (like a double click on your mouse) works similar, but will (at the moment) always trigger a (single) TAP at the same position. Example for the upper edge: {DT_N:1} and before that: {TP_N:1} and some {TH_N:1...x}. Airwheel is a circular finger movement above the sensor, which will trigger a message {AW:0 ... 1023}.

We can measure and publish all kinds of data in parallel, but this will likely end up in an unusable situation. It is important to have a basic understanding of the sensor, to not get confused with seemingly unreasonable messages (DOUBLE TAP triggers a TOUCH (or more than one), then a TAP (after the first lift of the finger) and then a DOUBLE TAP. The naming conventions of the gestures are according to the data sheets from Microchip, because if we only would have simple FLICKS, it would have made it easy to use: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But we have EDGE FLICKS and various TOUCHES too, and so the direction name could be ambiguous. That's why we (have to) use NORTH-SOUTH, EAST-WEST ... and NORTH, SOUTH, .... and CENTRE. To make the MQTT messages not too long, some useful abbreviations have to be found. This is definitely work in progress. KNOWN ISSUES: ~ After the initial flashing the ESP8266/TASMOTA can freeze at startup with a connected sensor board. If this happens disconnect the wires from the MGC3130-board (I 2 C-wires should be enough), reboot and reconnect. Keep in mind, that in general many things will interfere with an electrical field.

If you have no knowledge of what MQTT is, you can learn about it from MQTT Essentials articles. Configure MQTT ~ If you flashed a precompiled .bin or didn't enter MQTT info in user_config_override.h before compiling you have to configure it on your device first. Configure MQTT using WebUI ~ Go to Configuration -> Configure Other and make sure \"MQTT Enable\" box is checked. Once MQTT is enabled you need to set it up using Configuration -> Configure MQTT . Tip While here, you might as well change the Friendly Name into something more descriptive than generic \"Tasmota\". This is a must for Home Assistant autodiscovery feature. For a basic setup you only need to set Host , User and Password but it is recommended to change Topic to avoid issues. Each device should have a unique Topic . Host = your MQTT broker address or IP ( mDNS is not available in the official Tasmota builds , means no .local domain!) Port = your MQTT broker port (default port is set to 1883) Client = device's unique identifier. In 99% of cases it's okay to leave it as is, however some Cloud-based MQTT brokers require a ClientID connected to your account. User = username for authenticating on your MQTT broker Password = password for authenticating on your MQTT broker Topic = unique identifying topic for your device (e.g. hallswitch , kitchen-light ). %topic% in wiki references to this. It is recommended to use a single word for the topic. FullTopic = full topic definition . Modify it if you want to use multi-level topics for your devices, for example lights/%prefix%/%topic%/ or %prefix%/top_floor/bathroom/%topic%/ etc. Configure MQTT using Backlog ~ Using a serial connection or the WebUI Console you can issue (or even better, paste a premade) Backlog command for quick and easy MQTT setup. Backlog mqtthost < mqtt_broker_address > ; mqttport < mqtt_broker_port > ; mqttuser < username > ; mqttpassword < password > ; topic < device_topic > After a reboot all necessary MQTT settings are configured. Don't forget, you can use Backlog for all commands! Commands over MQTT ~ To send commands and view responses you'll need an MQTT client . Commands over MQTT are issued to Tasmota by using cmnd/%topic%/<command> <parameter> . If there is no <parameter> (an empty MQTT message/payload), a query is sent for current status of the <command> . Tip If you are using mosquitto_pub , you can issue an empty payload using the -n command line option. If your MQTT client cannot issue an empty payload, you can use the single character ? instead. Command flow ~ The following example will go in depth on what happens when you send an MQTT command. A device was flashed and configured with the FullTopic as default %prefix%/%topic%/ and the Topic set to tasmota_switch . We want to see the current status of the switch and change it. By looking at the commands table we can learn about the POWER command and options associated with it. Ask the device for status cmnd / tasmota_switch / Power \u2190 // an empty message/payload sends a status query \u21b3 stat / tasmota_switch / RESULT \u2192 { \"POWER\" : \"OFF\" } \u21b3 stat / tasmota_switch / POWER \u2192 OFF We can see that the switch (device's relay) is turned off. Send a command to toggle the relay cmnd / tasmota_switch / Power \u2190 \"TOGGLE\" \u21b3 // Power for relay 1 is toggled \u21b3 stat / tasmota_switch / RESULT \u2192 { \"POWER\" : \"ON\" } \u21b3 stat / tasmota_switch / POWER \u2192 ON We've sent the toggle command and received confirmation that the switch is turned on. Tip By default, Tasmota replies to all commands through .../RESULT . This behavior can be changed using SetOption4 , which makes the commands reply on the endpoint matching the command name, ex. cmnd/tasmota/PowerOnState will send a response on cmnd/tasmota/POWERONSTATE . Examples ~ In the following examples %topic% is tasmota , FullTopic is %prefix%/%topic%/ , and prefixes are default cmnd/stat/tele : The relay can be controlled with cmnd/tasmota/POWER on , cmnd/tasmota/POWER off or cmnd/tasmota/POWER toggle . Tasmota will send a MQTT status message like stat/tasmota/POWER ON . Power state message can be sent with the retain flag set using PowerRetain 1 . Telemetry messages can also be sent with the retain flag using SensorRetain . For Sonoff Dual or Sonoff 4CH the relays need to be addressed with cmnd/tasmota/POWER<x> , where {x} is the relay number from 1 to 2 (Sonoff Dual) or from 1 to 4 (Sonoff 4CH). cmnd/tasmota/POWER4 off turns off the 4th relay on a Sonoff 4CH. MQTT topic can be changed with cmnd/tasmota/Topic tasmota1 which reboots Tasmota and changes the %topic% to tasmota1 . From that point on MQTT commands should look like cmnd/tasmota1/POWER on . The OTA firmware location can be made known to tasmota with cmnd/tasmota/OtaUrl http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/tasmota.bin . Reset to default with cmnd/tasmota/OtaUrl 1 . Upgrade OTA firmware from the OtaUrl server with cmnd/tasmota/Upgrade 1 . Show all status information with cmnd/tasmota/Status 0 . The button can send a MQTT message to the broker that in turn will switch the relay. To configure this you need to perform cmnd/tasmota/ButtonTopic tasmota where tasmota equals to Topic. The message can also be provided with the retain flag by cmnd/tasmota/ButtonRetain on . Sonoff Pow (and any device with sensors) status can be requested manually with cmnd/tasmota/status 8 . Additionally, Tasmota periodically sends telemetry every TelePeriod , which defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes). When a Sonoff Pow (and any device with power metering sensors) threshold like PowerLow has been met a message tele/tasmota/POWER_LOW ON will be sent. When the error is corrected a message tele/tasmota/POWER_LOW OFF will be sent. While most MQTT commands will result in a message in JSON format the power status feedback will always be returned like stat/tasmota/POWER ON as well. Telemetry data will be sent by prefix tele like tele/tasmota/SENSOR {\"Time\":\"2017-02-16T10:13:52\", \"DS18B20\":{\"Temperature\":20.6}} MQTT Topic Definition ~ FullTopic ~ This is the MQTT topic used to communicate with Tasmota over MQTT. It is created using tokens placed within a user definable string (100 character limit). The tokens are substituted dynamically at run-time. Available substitution tokens are: %prefix% = one of three prefixes as defined by commands Prefix1 (default = cmnd ) , Prefix2 (default = stat ) and Prefix3 (default = tele ) . %topic% = one of five topics as defined by commands Topic , GroupTopic , ButtonTopic , SwitchTopic and MqttClient . %hostname% = the hostname of the device as defined through the web UI (default = %s-%04d ) or via Hostname command. %id% = MAC address of the device. Tip These substitution tokens will be used in examples across the documentation If FullTopic does not contain the %topic% token, the device will not subscribe to GroupTopic and FallbackTopic . Tip The order of %prefix% and %topic% doesn't matter, unless you have enabled Auto-discovery for Home Assistant ( SetOption19 ). Enabling this option re-formats the FullTopic to required order. Using the tokens the following example topics can be made: FullTopic %prefix%/%topic%/ default FullTopic tasmota/%topic%/%prefix%/ FullTopic tasmota/bedroom/%topic%/%prefix%/ FullTopic penthouse/bedroom1/bathroom2/%topic%/%prefix%/ FullTopic %prefix%/home/cellar/%topic%/ %prefix% Tasmota uses 3 prefixes for forming a FullTopic: cmnd - prefix to issue commands; ask for status stat - reports back status or configuration message tele - reports telemetry info at specified intervals Warning To solve possible MQTT topic loops it is strongly suggested that you use the %prefix% token in all of your FullTopics. Status and telemetry do not need a prefix. %topic% ~ All MQTT status messages will be sent using the configurable %topic% which must be made unique by the user. It can be called bedroom but it could also be called XP-TS_10 as long as the user knows what it is and where to find it. Default Topic is tasmota_XXXXXX where XXXXXX is unique and derives from the last 6 characters of the MAC address The use of the %topic% token is mandatory in case you want to use ButtonTopic and/or SwitchTopic . It also provides for GroupTopic and Fallback Topic functionality. Tip Use %prefix% and %topic% tokens at all time within your FullTopic definition! GroupTopic ~ Having two devices with the same topic allowed for MQTT commands to be sent once to make the devices act in conjunction. That inspired a third topic called GroupTopic. Devices with the same GroupTopic will all listen to that GroupTopic and react to the same MQTT command sent to it. You can use this to take global actions like updating firmware on all devices or split up devices into different groups using a unique GroupTopic for each group. Default GroupTopic is tasmotas FallBack Topic ~ Initially Tasmota had one MQTT configurable topic planned called Topic. It soon became apparent that when two devices come online with the same topic this would be a challenge, to say the least! Tasmota then introduced a unique, non-configurable \"FallBack Topic\" that allows MQTT communication regardless of the configurable topic. This fallback topic is just what it is meant to be: a fallback topic in case of emergency! By default the Fallback Topic is DVES_XXXXXX_fb where xxxxxx is derived from the last 6 charactes of the device's MAC address (excluding : ). It might look something like this: DVES_3D5E26_fb . You can find out the DVES code by looking at Information page in the webUI or issuing Status 6 : 12 : 36 : 17 MQT: stat/tasmota/STATUS 6 = { \"StatusMQT\" :{ \"MqttHost\" : \"1.1.1.1\" , \"MqttPort\" : 1883 , \"MqttClientMask\" : \"DVES_%06X\" , \"MqttClient\" : \"DVES_3D5E26\" , \"MqttUser\" : \"tasmota\" , \"MqttCount\" : 1 , \"MAX_PACKET_SIZE\" : 1000 , \"KEEPALIVE\" : 30 }} Retained MQTT Messages ~ If MQTT is defined and PowerRetain is used the last state will be stored permanently in MQTT database. Command Description PowerRetain Show current MQTT power retain state. 0 / off = disable MQTT power retain on status update (default) 1 / on = enable MQTT power retain on status update BUT , a message in your MQTT broker flagged as 'retained' will always override the PowerOnState . This is usually the main cause for \"ghost switching\". Learn more in MQTT retained messages explained . Check out this tutorial for troubleshooting switch ghosting. Clearing Retained Messages ~ To check, if there is a retain flag set for the switch's power topic, monitor cmnd/+/power in a MQTT client (recommended MQTT.fx for Windows or Eclipse Mosquitto in linux). You can use Tasmota Device Manager to clear all retained messages for selected device with a single click. or use the following tutorials/forum threads: Clearing retained messages with mosquitto Remove retained messages in Home Assistant Remove retained messages in hass.io MQTT addon","title":"MQTT"},{"location":"MQTT/#configure-mqtt","text":"If you flashed a precompiled .bin or didn't enter MQTT info in user_config_override.h before compiling you have to configure it on your device first.","title":"Configure MQTT"},{"location":"MQTT/#configure-mqtt-using-webui","text":"Go to Configuration -> Configure Other and make sure \"MQTT Enable\" box is checked.

Compatible Open Therm Adapters ~ Ihor Melnyk OpenTherm Adapter OpenTherm Gateway Arduino shield Both adapters have a fully isolated circuit from the boiler. However, please be aware that you can damage your boiler. You may also void your boiler warranty by installing this hardware. Please consult with your boiler manufacturer. Note For my home automation project, I used OpenTherm Gateway Arduino shield ; however, this project uses OpenTherm library from Ihor Melnyk . I assume both adapters will work. Please note, this integration does not work with the OTGW . You might want to take a look at the HA OpenTherm GW Connecting to the Boiler ~ Current integration acts as a master to the boiler. Note If OpenTherm master device is present, the boiler may disable it's front panel controls. Users may not be able to set a boiler and hot water temperature through the boiler. Now it's the responsibility of the master device. This behavior might vary across different boilers. You may disable this behavior by removing OpenTherm Slave Status command. However, the integration will not be able to read flame/heating/failure flags. OpenTherm Gateway Arduino shield support a gateway mode. As of now, this mode does not supported by the integration. As of now, gateway mode is not supported Setting Up Tasmota ~ Note You need to define USE_OPENTHERM and rebuild Tasmota to enable OpenTherm integration. Log into your Tasmota device Go to Configuration -> Configure Module Select Generic module type, save & restart In the Module parameters window, assign OpenTherm RX and OpenTherm TX to the corresponding pins Save settings and restart Note The integration attaches ISR to the RX GPIO to avoid pooling. That GPIO should support interrupts. Please consider this while working on the schematics.

Note Your boiler may not respond to some of the OpenTherm commands. The integration made 3 attempts to execute the command. If the third attempt failed, the command marked as not supported and excluded from the rotation. External Thermostat Wiring and Safety ~ Central heating is the last thing you want to fail in your home. You might have significant damage to your property in case of the software bug or your custom hardware or wiring failure. As a last resort measure, you probably want to use some sort of mechanical thermostat, which turns on your boiler if the temperature drops below the safe threshold. In the worst-case scenario, your OpenTherm hardware stop communicating with the boiler. Proper boiler implementation will flag external panel error and take control back, following the external thermostat circuit state. The second issue can be with your thermostat logic, especially if your logic is running on some external device. To address this, OpenTherm integration is using Diagnostics Indication to enable central heating. That way, if your external thermostat report freezing condition, OpenTherm integration activates heating. To enable this option, set the CHOD flag. Note Another use case for the CHOD flag might be an external hot water tank storage using central heating to heat the hot water in the tank. Configuration ~ OpenTherm integration supports the following commands. ot_flags Get/Set OpenTherm flags ot_tboiler Get/Set central heating temperature ot_twater Get/Set domestic hot water temperature ot_save_setpoints Save central heating and domestic hot water temperatures ot_ch Activate/Deactivate central heating ot_flags command ~ OpenTherm integration supports the following flags: CHOD - Enable CH (central heating) on diagnostics flag. See External Thermostat section DHW - Enable Domestic Hot Water.

You might have significant damage to your property in case of the software bug or your custom hardware or wiring failure. As a last resort measure, you probably want to use some sort of mechanical thermostat, which turns on your boiler if the temperature drops below the safe threshold. In the worst-case scenario, your OpenTherm hardware stop communicating with the boiler. Proper boiler implementation will flag external panel error and take control back, following the external thermostat circuit state. The second issue can be with your thermostat logic, especially if your logic is running on some external device. To address this, OpenTherm integration is using Diagnostics Indication to enable central heating. That way, if your external thermostat report freezing condition, OpenTherm integration activates heating. To enable this option, set the CHOD flag.

After restart Tasmota needs some time to completely configure its state. In this time frame it is likely to miss some gestures. This should stabilize after a few moments. Commands ~ To use the sensor you need to switch to the desired mode of operation with Sensor50 <x> where <x> = 0\u20265 . It will not appear in the webUI but it can be observed via MQTT messages in console. 0 - Off Sensor muted, no readings in Tasmota. 1 - Gesture Mode Reports gesture movement with: \u2003 Up \u2003 Down \u2003 Left \u2003 Right \u2003 Near \u2003 Far \u2003 CW (clockwise rotation) \u2003 CCW (counter-clockwise rotation) As expected, \"Near\" and \"Far\" gestures are tricky and you have to train your movements to catch them. Sometimes the sensor reports \"Near\" and \"Far\" at once (which will be discarded). There is some postprocessing to allow the object (hand or finger) to move into the sensing area and delay the initial direction report (up, down, left, right) to give the chance to trigger (the intended) \"Near\" or \"Far\" movement. Especially \"Far\" is a bit harder to achieve. example: \u2026{Up:1} = up gesture once \u2026{Left:3} = left gesture 3 times in a row, without any other gesture in between 2 - Proximity Mode Arbitrary values between 0 (far away) and 255 (very near) are given. Exit from the sensor field will always give at least one \"zero message\". tele is only triggered, when the value has changed. example: \u2026{Proximity:255} = close proximity, almost touching the sensor \u2026{Proximity:0} = object has left the sensing area 3 - Corner Mode Sensing area is organised in quarters. An object in one of the corners will trigger the corresponding number. 1 2 3 4 example: \u2026{Corner:2} = object in upper right corner 4 - PIN Mode: A fluent movement of an object through a given sequence of corners (similar to unlocking a smartphone) will trigger a valid \"PIN\". The next corner must be reached in about 0.7 seconds. example: \u2026{PIN:1} = valid PIN 5 - Cursor Mode: Shows x- and y-coordinates. Mainly intended for debugging and \"seeing\" the sensing area. This reads only the upper 5-bit-values, which automatically removes much of the jitter, giving values between 0 and 15. example: \u2026{x:1, y:15} = upper left corner The sensor provides some more goodies, like velocity of an object, so if someone has a fancy use case for this, feel free to open a feature request. Of course it would be possible to mix the modes, but this can produce a lot of MQTT-messages. This could be added later upon user request (based on real world use cases).

Support was added in line with the datasheet specification insofar that the PWM frequency can be set from 24hz all the way up to 1526hz. This driver does not currently have any perpetual settings so will revert to a base frequency of 50hz (usually suitable for most applications) and will be set in an OFF state for all pins during power-up and/or reset. The latter may change as the driver grows in cases where user requirements and development requirements are met. USAGE OF THE PCA9685 DRIVER IN TASMOTA ~ The driver needs to be connected to the I 2 C bus of your Tasmota powered device (note that most Sonoff devices will not have reachable I 2 C pins so it's applicable to a limited number, so most likely only applicable to bare ESP8266 or WeMos type users. If you modify a Sonoff or similar device to gain access to the I 2 C bus please be aware that other problems may persist and that for such use cases support in Tasmota chat or Issues is not guaranteed in any way whatsoever) The driver is not included during the compilation of the standard released binaries so in order to use this driver you will need to create a development environment for yourself and uncomment these two lines in my_user_config.h #define USE_PCA9685 #define USE_PCA9685_ADDR 0x40 #define USE_PCA9685_FREQ 50 // Support is for 24 to 1526 Hz For information on how to set up a development environment please check the wiki on Arduino IDE (the easiest, probably) or PlatformIO Note that the I 2 C selection must correspond with how you have wired the module or chip as incorrect addressing will result in the PCA9685 not being detected. The valid I 2 C address range is 0x40 through 0x47 for the PCA9685 and most off-the-shelf modules would likely default to 0x40. If you are unsure please use I2CScan from Tasmota console to scan for devices on the I 2 C bus and you should find a device within the mentioned range. You may also get a discovery on 0x70 but please do not use this address as it is a broadcast address and the driver does not currently support its implementation. Also be aware of other I 2 C devices you have connected to the same Tasmota driven device in order to avoid I 2 C address conflicts. Once connected, correctly flashed, and configured Tasmota will detect the device automatically on startup. DRIVER USAGE ~ There is no web interface for this driver. The driver is used via MQTT or console command using the following available commands and their respective parameters driver15 pwmf,frequency // where frequency is the PWM frequency from 24 to 1526 in Hz driver15 pwm,pin,pwmvalue // where pin = LED pin 0 through 15 and pwmvalue is the pulse width between 0 and 4096 driver15 pwm,pin,ON // Fully turn a specific pin/LED ON driver15 pwm,pin,OFF // Fully turn a specific pin/LED OFF driver15 reset // Reset to power-up settings - i.e. F=50hz and all pins in OFF state driver15 status // Will return a JSON string containing all the current settings / parameters OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ~ Please remember to consider the voltage and current limitations of the chip and per pin output current limitations as outlined in the datasheet. You may also get a discovery on 0x70 but please do not use this address as it is a broadcast address and the driver does not currently support its implementation.

The PID algorithm is one designed to be used to control real-world processes that the users of Sonoff devices are likely to encounter. This includes room heating/cooling, temperature control when brewing, and a multitude of other processes. The PID tuning parameters are designed to be meaningful in the real world (rather than the abstract Ki Kd Kp that are often used which are completely meaningless to most). The algorithm is based on that in the node-red node node-red-contrib-pid which has been well received. In use it can either regularly be given the current process value via MQTT or if the device has a sensor attached then that sensor can be used to read the process value. So using a TH10 with a DS18B20 the complete PID loop control can be build into the device so that the process will continue to be controlled even if the wifi is down. This is a very cost effective way of achieving PID control. The algorithm allows the relay to be used in a time proportioned way using the Time Proportioned output extension. The loop tuning parameters can be set at build time and can be adjusted at run time via MQTT. To add the feature into the standard Tasmotta s/w (at least version 5.12.0 is required) then have a look at the pid_branch of the tasmota fork at https://github.com/colinl/Sonoff-Tasmota/tree/pid_branch. Pick up from there the files in the folder lib/ProcessControl (which are from this process-control repository ) and sonoff/xdrv_91_timeprop.ino and sonoff/xdrv_92_pid.ino and add them into your Tasmota sources. The PID code adds about 4.3k and the Timeprop code another 1.2k Instructions for setup are in the two xdrv files. The ESP8266 will run the PID algorithm at 1 cycle per second, which is much faster than is needed for the sort of processes Sonoff devices are usually associated with. It rather clobbers the Tasmota terminal output in the web browser at that rate so it is getting near to the limit. The maximum anyone is likely to need it running at is maybe once every 5 seconds, and the majority of home IoT applications probably nearer once per minute would be sufficient, so the device is well up to the task. Help with using the PID algorithm and with loop tuning can be found at http://blog.clanlaw.org.uk/2018/01/09/PID-tuning-with-node-red-contrib-pid.html This is directed towards using the algorithm in the node-red node node-red-contrib-pid but the algorithm here is based on the same code so the tuning technique described there should work just the same. Due to limited hardware availability this has so far only been tested in a Sonoff Basic and a TH10, if there are any issues running this on other hardware let me know. For any issues please submit an issue to the Tasmota fork on gitub or ask on the sonoff mailing list .","title":"PID Control"},{"location":"PIR-Motion-Sensors/","text":"PIR motion sensors, albeit called sensors, are configured as switches in Tasmota since they basically report motion ( 1 ) or no motion ( 0 ) to the device.

PWM Dimmer module adds support PWM dimmer switches. The brightness of the load for these dimmers is controlled by a PWM GPIO pin. They typically have power, up and down buttons, a powered-on LED, five brightness LEDs and another status LED. Some of supported devices are switches model SD0x from Martin Jerry, Acenx, Tessan, NTONPOWER. PWM Dimmer Operation ~ Pressing and releasing the power button toggles the power on/off. If the toggle turns the power on, the load is returned to the last brightness it was adjusted to. If Fade is enabled, the load is faded on/off at the rate defined by the Speed setting. When the power is on, holding the down or up button decreases/increases the brightness. The brightness can also be changed using just the power button. When the power is on, holding the power button alternately increases or decreases the brightness. Initially, holding the power button increases the brightness. Releasing and then holding the power button again decreases the brightness. When the power is off, pressing and releasing the down or up button turns the power on at a temporary brightness of the low/high levels set by the BriPreset command. Turning the power on at the low preset can also be accomplished by holding the power button while the power is off. The brightness presets are intended to enable quickly turning on a light to a dim or bright level without changing the normal desired brightness. Turning the power on to a preset does not change the brightness the load will be set to when the switch is turned on the next time. For example, if the light is on and you adjust the brightness to 80 and then turn the light off, when you turn it back on, the brightness will return to 80. If you turn the power off again and then press the down button, the light will be turned on with a brightness of the low preset. If you then turn the light off and on again, the brightness will return to 80. When the power is off, holding the down or up button publishes an MQTT EVENT command. The topic follows the format of the Full Topic with a prefix of Event (ex. cmnd/LightSwitch1/EVENT ). The MQTT payload is Trigger#, where # is 1 if the down button is held or 2 if the up button is held. These triggers can be used in rules on remote devices (ON Event#Trigger1 ) or by automation software to trigger automations such as scene changes. For example, the Event topic Trigger1 payload could trigger the automation software to turn on the previous scene in a list and the Trigger2 payload could trigger the automation software to turn on the next scene in a list. If there are LED\u2019s defined in the template, they are turned on to indicate the current brightness. More LEDs are turned on at higher brightnesses. Option 86 enables/disables an LED timeout. If SetOption86 is enabled, the LED\u2019s turn off five seconds after the last change in brightness. Note that the lowest LED and the blue power LED are always on when the power is on. The LED timeout can also be enabled/disabled by holding the power button while tapping (pressing and releasing quickly) the down button. The LEDLink LED can be used as a nightlight/powered-off indicator. SetOption 87 enables/disables turning the LEDLink LED on when the power is off. The powered-off indicator can also be enabled/disabled by holding the power button and tapping the up button. Holding the power button, tapping the down button and then tapping or holding the down or up button sends a device group message to set RGB lights in the device group to the previous/next fixed color. The command is sent/value is adjusted once every .5 seconds for as long as the button is held. The color sequence as defined by the Light module is red, green, blue, orange, light green, light blue, amber, cyan, purple, yellow, pink, white using RGB channels, white using CT channels. Holding the power button, tapping the up button and then tapping or holding the down or up button publishes an MQTT Event command. The command is sent/value is adjusted once every .5 seconds for as long as the button is held. The MQTT topic is as described above. The MQTT payload is Trigger#, where # is 3 if the down button is held or 4 if the up button is held. Holding any button alone for over 10 seconds executes the WiFiConfig 2 command. SetOption32 defines the button hold time. When the PWM Dimmer module is initially selected, SetOption32 is set to 5 (1/2 second). Button presses and holds execute the normal ButtonTopic and Rule processing. If ButtonTopic is set and SetOption61 is 0 or a the button press/hold matches a rule, the button press/hold is ignored by PWM Dimmer. PWM Dimmer uses the Light module to control PWM. Brightness levels are rescaled to PWM values between the dimmer_min and dimmer_max values specified with DimmerRange . Most LED bulbs do not show a significant difference between PWM value of 1 and PWM value of 100. This results in the lower 10% of the dimmer range having no effect. For best results, DimmerRange <dimmerMin> value should be set to the highest value that results in the lowest bulb brightness (Typically in the range of 90 - 120). When Device Groups are enabled, the PWM Dimmer brightness presets are kept in sync across all switches in the group. The powered-off LED and LED timeout settings are specific to each switch. Changing them does not replicate the change to the other switches in the group. Commands ~ Command Parameters BriPreset <low>,<high> = set brightness low and high presets 1..255 = set brightness preset + = increase brightness preset - = decrease brightness preset SetOption86 Set brightness LED timeout 0 = disable timeout (default) 1 = enable timeout SetOption87 Set powered-off LED (nightlight) 0 = disable powered-off LED (default) 1 = enable powered-off LED SetOption88 Set remote device mode 0 = disable remote device mode(default) 1 = enable remote device mode Remote Device Mode ~ Remote device mode allows PWM Dimmer switches to control remote devices. With remote device mode enabled, each button controls a different device. Note that dimmer switches with toggle-style down/up buttons have limited functionality as remote device mode switches because you can not push the down and up buttons simultaneously. Remote device mode is included in the default Tasmota binary. To include remote device mode support in other builds, define USE_PWM_DIMMER_REMOTE and USE_DEVICE_GROUPS in your user_config_override. Remote device mode support requires device group support. Remote device mode support adds 1K to the code size in addition to the code size required for device groups support. To enable remote device mode, execute SetOption88 1 (the device will restart). Each remote device must be running firmware with device group support and have remote device support enabled. Remote devices do not need to be built with PWM dimmer support nor do they need to be switches. If a remote device also uses the PWM Dimmer module, the device acts like a 3-way dimmer switch and may or may not have a load connected to it. It\u2019s also possible to use a PWM dimmer switch without a load to act as a wall switch to control the power, brightness and color of one or more smart lights with Tasmota with device group support loaded on them. With remote device mode is enabled, button 1 is the power button for the local device while buttons 2 and 3 are the power buttons for remote devices. Group names for buttons 2 and 3 are set by the GroupTopic2 and GroupTopic3 commands respectively. Note that the button numbers are defined by the module template and can be in any physical order on the switch (button 1 can be defined as the top button, the middle button or the bottom button). Button combinations that publish MQTT Event commands use a topic in the format cmnd/%group-topic%/EVENT . Pressing and releasing a power button toggles the power on all devices in the group assigned to the button. When the power is on, holding the button alternately increases or decreases the brightness. When the power is off, holding the button turns the power on at a temporary brightness of the low level set by the BriPreset command. While holding a power button, the other two buttons act like the down and up buttons for the remote device. All the functions performed by the down and up buttons in non-remote device mode are available in remote device mode. While holding button 1, button 2 performs the functions of the down button and button 3 performs the functions of the up button. While holding button 2, button 1 performs the functions of the down button and button 3 performs the functions of the up button. While holding button 3, button 1 performs the functions of the down button and button 2 performs the functions of the up button.","title":"PWM Dimmer"},{"location":"PWM-dimmer-switch/#pwm-dimmer","text":"PWM dimmer is supported in standard tasmota.bin To enable PWM dimmer operation, select the PWM Dimmer module.

PZEM-004 ~ The PZEM-004T together with a Sonoff Basic provide a good clamp on energy monitor. Parts needed ~ Sonoff Basic PZEM-004T Resistor 1k Enclosure Power cable Preparation ~ Install Tasmota on the Sonoff Basic and confirm it is functional before connecting the PZEM-004T to its serial interface. Hardware connections ~ As the PZEM-004T RX optocoupler series resistor (1K ohm, R15 for v.1 .0 and R8 for v.3.0 ) is designed for 5V, that resistor value had to be reduced in order to achieve the current for driving the RX optocoupler diode. This can be accomplished by soldering a 1k resistor between the joints shown below (modification works for version v.1.0 and v.3.0). The resistor has to be connected between VDD (5V/3.3V) terminal and the RX opto terminal 1. PZEM-004T v.1.0 PZEM-004T v.3.0 It can be used a SMD resistor 102 or 1001 (1K) soldered near/parallel with R8 or a normal resistor (THT) similar to that used on the image of v.1.0 The resistor is placed in different place on v.3.0 because the optocouplers RX and TX are reversed compared to v.1.0 Connect the serial interface of the Sonoff Basic with the serial interface of the PZEM-004T. See pictures regarding used colors and connections. 3V3/5V Red Rx Yellow Tx Green Gnd Grey (Image re-used from https://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Homie-Firmware-to-Drive-Sonoff-Switch-Module-E/ Thanks @amayii0) If you need 5V you can use directly from Sonoff (for something else) but do not connect to PZEM logic because this will result in a big flash (kaboom!, the sonoff LIVE line may reach the PZEM NEUTRAL or viceversa). Using 5V from Sonoff for PZEM TTL port is safe but the resistor mod explained above must be undoed and another mod is needed for dropping the PZEM TX line from 5V to 3.3V. So, the simplest way is to use 3.3V from Sonoff to 5V TTL terminal of the PZEM and the resistor mod explained in the above images. Cut the power cable in two and connect the input wires to both Sonoff Basic and PZEM-004T. Route one of the power output wires through the PZEM-004T core and connect the output wires to the Sonoff Basic output.

PZEM-016 ~ DO NOT PERFORM THIS MODIFICATION WITHOUT REMOVING POWER FROM THE PZEM FIRST! Note : the PZEM-016 TTL output is at 5V signal levels. There are varying schools of thought on whether the ESP82xx has 5V tolerant GPIO. You may want to use a level shifter for the serial communications signals to bring them to the recommended 3.3V. PZEM-016 modules can be converted from RS485 to TTL serial level devices by simply removing the internal MAX485 chip and adding two internal jumper wires. This will bring the serial port connections out via the four-pin terminal block. Pin A is now TTL serial out (Tx) and pin B TTL serial in (Rx). The modification retains the optical isolation used by the PZEM for safety to ensure no high voltages on the outputs. You can use a voltage level shifter to power the ESP82xx from the PZEM-016 module's 5V power. This may also require a 470uf 35V capacitor across the 5V line to work reliably. Tasmota Configuration ~ It is recommended to use GPIO1/GPIO3 or GPIO13/GPIO15 for the most reliable serial communications. You can use any GPIO but anything else will use serial emulation (software).

This can be accomplished by soldering a 1k resistor between the joints shown below (modification works for version v.1.0 and v.3.0). The resistor has to be connected between VDD (5V/3.3V) terminal and the RX opto terminal 1. PZEM-004T v.1.0 PZEM-004T v.3.0 It can be used a SMD resistor 102 or 1001 (1K) soldered near/parallel with R8 or a normal resistor (THT) similar to that used on the image of v.1.0 The resistor is placed in different place on v.3.0 because the optocouplers RX and TX are reversed compared to v.1.0 Connect the serial interface of the Sonoff Basic with the serial interface of the PZEM-004T.

Using 5V from Sonoff for PZEM TTL port is safe but the resistor mod explained above must be undoed and another mod is needed for dropping the PZEM TX line from 5V to 3.3V. So, the simplest way is to use 3.3V from Sonoff to 5V TTL terminal of the PZEM and the resistor mod explained in the above images. Cut the power cable in two and connect the input wires to both Sonoff Basic and PZEM-004T. Route one of the power output wires through the PZEM-004T core and connect the output wires to the Sonoff Basic output.

Supported peripherals list. Tasmota Settings ~ Tasmota allows for easy selection of peripherals and assignment to GPIO pins. Configuration is possible in the webUI Configuration - Configure Module page or by using commands: Module and GPIO , or Template . Module ~ First select desired module for the device (Wait for the restart). Depending on the type of Module , only certain GPIO pins are user configurable. Module Generic (18) has all the GPIOs configurable. Modules shows supported modules GPIO ~ Assign a component to a GPIO. GPIO14 2 configures sensor AM2301 to GPIO14_ Backlog GPIO14 5; GPIO4 6 sets I 2 C SCL to GPIO14 and I 2 C SDA to GPIO4 Tasmota will auto-detect all connected and supported I 2 C devices. If you have conflicting I 2 C addresses see I2CDevices GPIOs All shows list of all available components by name and index For a peripheral to show up you may need to power cycle your device instead of a soft restart. Template ~ Instead of using Module and GPIO you can define everything using Template . Read more... Additional Options ~ Measurement Units Temperature units can be set to Celsius or Fahrenheit with SetOption8 command. Pressure units can be set to hPa or mmHg with SetOption24 command. Update Interval To change the update interval (TelePeriod) of MQTT messages change the TelePeriod . Default interval is 300 seconds but can be set between 10 and 3600 seconds. TelePeriod 10 will set the update interval to 10 seconds, so the sensor will update 6 times a minute. Peripheral Specific Some peripherals offer, or even require, additional commands. See Sensor commands page for peripheral specific commands. Tip To make a link between the different naming schemes the Pin Definition overview in the ESP8266 wiki is quite helpful. Examples ~ Connect switch If you take a Sonoff Basic and connect a switch between pin4 (GND) and pin5 (GPIO14) of the 5 pin programming header you now have a second switch connected to the device. You can set this through the module config page as option Switch1 (9) or from the command line with gpio14 9 . See Buttons and Switches for more information. Connect jack Instead of connecting a switch, you could connect a 4-pin 2.5mm jack, with the pins wired: Jack Pin ESP8266 tip 5 GPIO14 R1 no connection R2 1 GND R3 4 3.3V You can then plug a sensor into the jack like you would to a Sonoff TH and define what sensor you have connected to GPIO14. Restrictions ~ Danger If you can avoid it, don't use GPIOs: 0, 1, 2, 6-11, 15 and 16 . That leaves 4, 5, 12, 13, 14 as GPIOs without any constraints. 3 being RX is also good to avoid (PWM is not working on this GPIO). Others can be used but you have to mind the constraints outlined in this document . Danger The ESP8266 is a 3.3V microcontroller, so its I/O operates at 3.3V as well. The pins are not 5V tolerant, applying more than 3.6V on any pin will release the magic smoke (fry the chip). The maximum current that can be drawn from a single GPIO pin is 12mA. It is important to have a reliable power supply The power supplied to the device is one of the most important elements for stable device operation. Many devices on the market have barely adequate power supplies for normal operation. Connected peripherals may strain the ability of the power supply on the device to deliver appropriate power to all the components, both on-board as well as externally connected. Voltage regulation issues typically result in fatal exception fault code 1 . You must ensure that the device receives sufficient power (current and appropriate voltage level). Take into account the current that each wired component (f.e. sensor) will draw from the device itself. Electrical Considerations ~ When you switch a GPIO pin to an input and hang a long wire off of it, that wire can pick up stray signals and cause the voltage on the GPIO pin to vary. This can cause the system to think the switch has changed. To fix this, there are several things you can do. add a pull-up resistor add a bypass capacitor shielding on the wire use twisted pair wiring A pull-up resistor is a resistor connected between the GPIO pin and 3.3v. The exact value of this is not critical, 4.7k is a common value to use, as is 10k. This ensures that when the switch it open, the GPIO pin will go high. A bypass capacitor is a small (pF range) capacitor that is connected between the GPIO and ground. This provides a path for any radio signals that are picked up by the wire to go to ground and not confuse the system. Shielding or using twisted pair wiring are other ways to reduce the effect of radio signals on the system. Example for 10K Resistor (issue #2708 ) ESP8266 In Depth ~ Complete document available from https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap04%20-%20Microcontroller.html Digital I/O ~ Just like a normal Arduino, the ESP8266 has digital input/output pins (I/O or GPIO, General Purpose Input/Output pins). As the name implies, they can be used as digital inputs to read a digital voltage, or as digital outputs to output either 0V (sink current) or 3.3V (source current). Usable Pins ~ The ESP8266 and ESP8285 have 17 GPIO pins (0-16) but several are reserved or have constraints . Do not use any of the reserved pins. If you do, you might crash your program. On the ESP8266, six pins (GPIO 6 - 11) are used to interface the flash memory (the small 8-legged chip usually right next to the ESP8266). The ESP8285 has its flash memory integrated into the chip which frees up GPIO 9 and 10. GPIO 1 and 3 are used as TX and RX of the hardware Serial port (UART), so in most cases, you can\u2019t use them as normal I/O while sending/receiving serial data. GPIO 1, 2 and 3 will cause boot failure if LOW on boot - use with care. Boot Mode Pins Some I/O pins have a special function during boot: They select 1 of 3 boot modes: GPIO15 GPIO0 GPIO2 Mode 0V 0V 3.3V Uart Bootloader 0V 3.3V 3.3V Boot sketch (SPI flash) 3.3V x x SDIO mode (not used for Arduino) Note: you don\u2019t have to add an external pull-up resistor to GPIO2, the internal one is enabled at boot. We have to be sure that these conditions are met by adding external resistors, or the board manufacturer of your board has added them for you. This has some implications, however: GPIO15 is always pulled low, so you can\u2019t use the internal pull-up resistor. You have to keep this in mind when using GPIO15 as an input to read a switch or connect it to a device with an open-collector (or open-drain) output, like I\u00b2C. GPIO0 is pulled high during normal operation, so you can\u2019t use it as a Hi-Z input. GPIO2 can\u2019t be low at boot, so you can\u2019t connect a switch to it. Internal pull-up/-down resistors GPIO 0-15 all have a built-in pull-up resistor, just like in an Arduino. GPIO16 has a built-in pull-down resistor. PWM ~ Unlike most Atmel chips (Arduino), the ESP8266 doesn\u2019t support hardware PWM, however, software PWM is supported on all digital pins. The default PWM range is 10-bits @ 1kHz, but this can be changed (up to >14-bit@1kHz). Check Restrictions . Analog Input ~ The ESP8266 has a single analog input, with an input range of 0 - 1.0V. If you supply 3.3V, for example, you will damage the chip. Some boards like the NodeMCU have an on-board resistive voltage divider, to get an easier 0 - 3.3V range. You could also just use a trimpot as a voltage divider. The ADC (analog to digital converter) has a resolution of 10 bits. Communication ~ Serial ~ The ESP8266 has two hardware UARTS (Serial ports): UART0 on pins 1 and 3 (TX0 and RX0 resp.), and UART1 on pins 2 and 8 (TX1 and RX1 resp.), however, GPIO8 is used to connect the flash chip. This means that UART1 can only transmit data. UART0 also has hardware flow control on pins 15 and 13 (RTS0 and CTS0 resp.). These two pins can also be used as alternative TX0 and RX0 pins. I\u00b2C ~ ESP8266 doesn\u2019t have a hardware TWI (Two Wire Interface) but it is implemented in software. This means that you can use pretty much any two digital pins. By default, the I\u00b2C library uses pin 4 as SDA and pin 5 as SCL. (The data sheet specifies GPIO2 as SDA and GPIO14 as SCL.) The maximum speed is approximately 450kHz. SPI ~ The ESP8266 has one SPI connection available to the user, referred to as HSPI. It uses GPIO14 as CLK, 12 as MISO, 13 as MOSI and 15 as Slave Select (SS). It can be used in both Slave and Master mode (in software).

Linux server: ~ If your MQTT broker is hosted on a local server, you may want your firmware web server used for Tasmota OTA updates to reside on the same server. Follow these steps to create it as a service: - Copy the python script on the Linux server: $ sudo su # mkdir /srv/tasmota/fw_server/fw # cd /srv/tasmota/fw_server # wget https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/tree/development/tools/fw_server/fw-server.py - Create a new file named tasmota.service in /etc/systemd/system/ and paste these lines (replace XYZ by your username): ``` [Unit] Description=Local OTA server for Tasmota Requires=network.target After=network.target multi-user.target [Service] User=XYZ Type=idle ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /srv/tasmota/fw_server/fw-server.py -d wlan0 Restart=on-failure [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target - User rights: The files and directories have been created as `root` but this is not desirable. Invoke the following commands (replace the four instances of `XYZ` by your username): # chown -hR XYZ:XYZ /srv/tasmota # chown XYZ:XYZ /etc/systemd/system/tasmota.service - Run the service: # systemctl daemon-reload # systemctl enable tasmota.service # systemctl start tasmota.service ``` If the server is rebooted, the service will automatically restart. - Check that the service is active and running: # systemctl status tasmota.service - Test the server: Copy new firmware files to the /srv/tasmota/fw_server/fw folder. Ensure that they have XYZ user rights in a similar fashion as shown above. You can use scp or a samba share. Copy the firmware files into the folder ( firmware.bin in the example below). The service can be tested from any browser by issuing the address http://<ip_address>:5000/firmware.bin were <ip_address> is the address of the Linux server. If the web server becomes unresponsive: After a power failure, your wlan0 IP may resolve to an invalid value like 169.254.5.153 because your LAN gateway was not ready when the web server restarted. If you notice that the OTA mechanism is broken, try to download the file from a browser. If you can't, then restart the service and check the status. Log in using a terminal session and enter: $ sudo su # systemctl restart tasmota.service # systemctl status tasmota.service If you recognize the IP address of your server on the last line of the status output, the web server should be OK. You can confirm that your OTA web server is restored by trying to download a file using your web browser.

Follow these steps to create it as a service: - Copy the python script on the Linux server: $ sudo su # mkdir /srv/tasmota/fw_server/fw # cd /srv/tasmota/fw_server # wget https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/tree/development/tools/fw_server/fw-server.py - Create a new file named tasmota.service in /etc/systemd/system/ and paste these lines (replace XYZ by your username): ``` [Unit] Description=Local OTA server for Tasmota Requires=network.target After=network.target multi-user.target [Service] User=XYZ Type=idle ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /srv/tasmota/fw_server/fw-server.py -d wlan0 Restart=on-failure [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target - User rights: The files and directories have been created as `root` but this is not desirable. Invoke the following commands (replace the four instances of `XYZ` by your username): # chown -hR XYZ:XYZ /srv/tasmota # chown XYZ:XYZ /etc/systemd/system/tasmota.service - Run the service: # systemctl daemon-reload # systemctl enable tasmota.service # systemctl start tasmota.service ``` If the server is rebooted, the service will automatically restart. - Check that the service is active and running: # systemctl status tasmota.service - Test the server: Copy new firmware files to the /srv/tasmota/fw_server/fw folder. Ensure that they have XYZ user rights in a similar fashion as shown above. You can use scp or a samba share. Copy the firmware files into the folder ( firmware.bin in the example below). The service can be tested from any browser by issuing the address http://<ip_address>:5000/firmware.bin were <ip_address> is the address of the Linux server. If the web server becomes unresponsive: After a power failure, your wlan0 IP may resolve to an invalid value like 169.254.5.153 because your LAN gateway was not ready when the web server restarted. If you notice that the OTA mechanism is broken, try to download the file from a browser. If you can't, then restart the service and check the status. Log in using a terminal session and enter: $ sudo su # systemctl restart tasmota.service # systemctl status tasmota.service If you recognize the IP address of your server on the last line of the status output, the web server should be OK. You can confirm that your OTA web server is restored by trying to download a file using your web browser.

Automation solutions can be implemented without having to add dedicated code or use external solutions. Rules perform actions based on triggers (e.g., switch state change, temperature threshold, events like system boot, a defined timer elapsing, custom defined events, etc.) They are stored in flash and therefore will survive a reboot. Note Most pre-compiled builds have the Rules feature enabled. If you are >compiling your own firmware, in order to use rules, include #define USE_RULES in user_config_override.h . List of Rules Commands Rule Syntax ~ Rule definition syntax ON < trigger > DO < command > [ ENDON | BREAK ] ON - marks the beginning of a rule <trigger> - what condition needs to occur for the rule to trigger DO - statement marking end of trigger and beginning of command part <command> - command that is executed if the <trigger> condition is met ENDON - marks the end of a rule. It can be followed by another rule. BREAK - marks the end of a rule. BREAK will stop the execution of the remaining rules that follow this rule within the rule set. If a rule that ends with BREAK is triggered, the following rules in that rule set will not be executed. This allows the rules to somewhat simulate an \"IF/ELSE\" statement. Rule sets are defined by using the Rule<x> command. After defining a rule set, you have to enable it (turn it on) using Rule<x> 1 . Similarly you can disable the rule set using Rule<x> 0 . Note If bootloops are detected all rules will be disabled as a precaution. See SetOption36 . There are three separate rule sets called Rule1 , Rule2 and Rule3 . Each rule set can contain many rules which are dynamically compressed. Number of rules that can fit in a rule set varies. Expect at least 1000 characters available per rule set. Whenever a rule set is enabled all the rules in it will be active. If the character count of the rules in one set actually exceeds the limit, start using the next rule set. If you have a long list of rules, verify the rules have all fit by inspecting the resulting log. Rules inside a rule set Rule<x> are concatenated and entered as a single statement. Rule < x > ON < trigger1 > DO < command > ENDON ON < trigger2 > DO < command > ENDON ... Spaces after ON , around DO , and before ENDON or BREAK are mandatory. A rule is not case sensitive. Rule Trigger ~ Rule trigger names are derived from the JSON message displayed in the console. Each JSON level (all values enclosed in {...} ) is separated in the trigger with a # . A rule trigger can consist of: [TriggerName]#[ValueName] [TriggerName]#[ValueName][comparison][value] [SensorName]#[ValueName] [SensorName]#[ValueName][comparison][value] Tele-[SensorName]#[ValueName] [TriggerName1]#[TriggerName2]#[ValueName] [TriggerName1]#?#[ValueName] Use ? as a wildcard for a single trigger level. Rule will trigger on [TriggerName]#?#[Value] where ? is any value. Example Rule with a trigger of ZBReceived#?#Power=0 will trigger on {\"ZBReceived\":{\"0x4773\":{\"Power\":0}}} and on {\"ZBReceived\":{\"aqara_switch\":{\"Power\":0}}} both. Note Same trigger may be used in more than one rule. This may be required for some cases of using IF/ELSE since an IF statement cannot be used within a Backlog . Rule Trigger Comparison Operators Operator Function = equal to (used for string comparison) == equal to (used for numerical comparison) > greater than < lesser than != not equal to >= greater than or equal to <= lesser than or equal to | used for modulo operation with remainder = 0 (exact division) Examples of Available Triggers This is just a sampling of available triggers to showcase what is possible and not a definitive list Trigger When it occurs Analog#A0div10 when the A0 input changes by more than 1% it provides a value between 0 and 100 Button2#State when a button changes state: 0 = OFF 1 = ON 2 = TOGGLE 3 = HOLD Clock#Timer=3 when global Timer3 is activated Dimmer#Boot occurs after Tasmota starts Dimmer#State when the value for Dimmer is changed Event#eventName when command Event eventName is executed.

The command's <parameter> can be replaced with %value% which will use the value of the trigger. ON Switch1#State DO Power %value% ENDON To accomplish a rule with one trigger but several commands, you need to use Backlog : ON <trigger> DO Backlog <command1>; <command2>; <command3> ENDON Appending new rule onto an existing rule set Use the + character to append a new rule to the rule set. For example: Existing Rule1: ON Rules#Timer=1 DO Mem2 %time% ENDON Rule to append: ON Button1#state DO POWER TOGGLE ENDON Command: Rule1 + ON button1#state DO POWER TOGGLE ENDON Resulting in Rule1 ON Rules # Timer = 1 DO Mem2 % time % ENDON ON Button1 # state DO POWER TOGGLE ENDON You can repeate the same trigger in rules. Rule ON Power2 # state = 1 DO Power1 1 ENDON ON Power2 # state = 1 DO RuleTimer1 100 ENDON Rule Variables ~ There are ten available variables (single precision reals) in Tasmota: Var1..Var5 and Mem1..Mem5 . They provide a means to store the trigger %value% to be used in any rule. All Var will be empty strings when the program starts. The value of all Mem persists after a reboot. The value of a Var<x> and Mem<x> can be: any number any text %var1% to %var5% %mem1% to %mem5% %time% %timestamp% %uptime% %sunrise% %sunset% %utctime% %topic% To set the value for Var<x> and Mem<x> use the command Var<x> <value> Mem<x> <value> The <value> can also be the value of the trigger of the rule.

To use it you must compile your build . Add the following to user_config_override.h : #define USE_EXPRESSION // Add support for expression evaluation in rules (+3k2 code, +64 bytes mem) #define SUPPORT_IF_STATEMENT // Add support for IF statement in rules (+4k2 code, -332 bytes mem) Beginning with Tasmota version 6.4.1.14, an optional feature for using mathematical expressions in rules was introduced. Supported Commands Once the feature is enabled, the use of expressions is supported in the following commands: Var Mem RuleTimer If conditional statement (requires #define SUPPORT_IF_STATEMENT ) Syntax Expressions can use of the following operators. They are listed by the order of operations priority, from higher to lower. ( ) (parentheses can be used to explicitly control the order of operations) ^ (power) % (modulo, division by zero returns modulo \"0\") * and / (multiplication and division; division by zero returns \"0\") + and - (addition and subtraction) Example 1+2*2 results in 5.0 as the multiplication is done first due to its higher priority (1+2)*2 results in 6.0 In addition to numeric constants, the following symbolic values can be used: Symbol Description VAR<x> variable (<x> = 1..MAX_RULE_VARS , e.g., VAR2 ) MEM<x> persistent variable (<x> = 1..MAX_RULE_MEMS , e.g., MEM3 ) TIME minutes past midnight UPTIME uptime minutes UTCTIME UTC time, UNIX timestamp, seconds since 01/01/1970 LOCALTIME local time, UNIX timestamp SUNRISE current sunrise time (minutes past midnight) SUNSET current sunset time (minutes past midnight) Example Mem1=((0.5*Var1)+10)*0.7 To use expressions in the Var , Mem and RuleTimer commands, an equal sign ( = ) character has to be used after the command. If not, the traditional syntax interpretation is used. Statement Var1 Result Var1=42 42 Var1 1+1 \"1+1\" (the literal string) Var1=1+1 2 Var1=sunset-sunrise duration of daylight in minutes Rule Cookbook ~ Long press on a switch ~ This example is for GPIOs defined as switches not buttons Activate long press action with Switchmode 5 and shorten long press time to 2 seconds ( Setoption32 20 ). Backlog SwitchMode 5 ; SetOption32 20 Rule ON switch1 # state = 3 DO publish cmnd / tasmota02 / POWER 2 ENDON Long pressing on switch1 sends POWER 2 (toggle action) command to the tasmota02 device Notice we use Rule which edits Rule1 rule set. They can be used interchangeably. If your rule does not trigger there could some constraints, in this case if SwitchTopic has a value it will override rules for switches and will need to be disabled: SwitchTopic 0 . Send MQTT message on button press ~ When a button is pressed the user has the possibility to send a MQTT message based on FullTopic and ButtonTopic. This MQTT message is going to be received by the MQTT broker and if there is any other device(s) subscribed to that Topic, it will receive also that message. So this approach can be used for sending messages/commands to MQTT Broker to Home Automation System, and/or sending messages/commands to MQTT Broker to other device(s). A problem with this solution is that on a Sonoff 4CH all four buttons will be sending the same MQTT topic using only a different Power index number like cmnd/ButtonTopic/Power3 toggle . By using a rule a single button can send any MQTT message allowing for more flexibility. Disable ButtonTopic as it overrides rules for buttons: ButtonTopic 0 Rule Rule1 ON button1 # state DO publish cmnd / ring2 / power % value % ENDON ON button2 # state DO publish cmnd / strip1 / power % value % ENDON You will need to enable this rule if it's the first time you've used rule with Rule1 1 Result When Button1 is pressed the rule kicks in and sends a MQTT message substituting variable %value% with the button state, f.e cmnd/ring2/Power 2 . When Button2 is pressed an MQTT message cmnd/strip1/Power 2 will be sent. Usage of one-shot (once) ~ The rule command once option provides the possibility to trigger only once ON a slow change while the change is still within the bounds of the test. Rule ON ENERGY # Current > 0.100 DO publish tool / tablesaw / power 1 ENDON ON ENERGY # Current < 0.100 DO publish tool / tablesaw / power 0 ENDON This creates a rule to publish MQTT commands whenever a Sonoff POW has current passing through it. Used as is, it will publish MQTT commands repeatedly, over and over, while current is >0.100 ... but, executing another command: Rule 5 Now the MQTT message will be sent once, and only once, while the condition is met. This is perfect for thermostat on/off depending on temperature, bathroom extractor fan on/off depending on humidity, workshop dust collector on/off depending on whether some dust-producing machine is running. It meets the 'hard thermostat' requests that have been common. Use a potentiometer ~ Connecting a potentiometer to the Analog A0 input and a rule can be used to control the dimmer state of any device. Hardware - Wemos D1 mini - Potentiometer of 2k2 connected to Gnd, A0 and 3V3 - WS2812 LED Rule ON analog # a0div10 DO dimmer % value % ENDON Result Turning the potentiometer the voltage on the analog input will change resulting in a value change of 0 (Off) to 100 for the trigger. Using this value to control the dimmer of the WS2812 will control the brightness of the led(s) Rule ON analog # a0div10 DO publish cmnd / grouplight / dimmer % value % ENDON Result This time all lights configured with GroupTopic grouplight will change their brightness according to the potentiometer position. NOTE: You might want to execute command SaveData 2 to reduce flash writes ;-) Use Zigbee to control Tasmota devices ~ This setup uses a Zigbee gateway with an Ikea remote switch paired. Ikea switch's name was set with ZbName to make it more user friendly. Rule Rule1 on zbreceived # ikea_switch # power = 1 do publish cmnd / backyard / POWER TOGGLE endon on zbreceived # ikea_switch # power = 0 do publish cmnd / hall_light / POWER TOGGLE endon Result Pressing I on the Ikea switch will toggle backyard device and pressing O toggles hall_light device. Button single press, double press and hold ~ [assuming Button1 and Setoption73 0] single press: Toggle Power1 double press: send a mqtt message hold 2 secs: send a different mqtt message Backlog ButtonTopic 0 ; SetOption1 1 ; SetOption11 1 ; SetOption32 20 Rule1 ON button1 # state = 3 DO publish cmnd / topicHOLD / power 2 ENDON ON button1 # state = 2 DO publish cmnd / topicDOUBLEPRESS / power 2 ENDON Rule1 1 Another example: [assuming Button1 and Setoption73 0] single press: send MQTT message double press: Toggle Power1 (SetOption11 swaps single and double press) hold 2 secs: send another mqtt message Backlog ButtonTopic 0 ; SetOption1 1 ; SetOption11 0 ; SetOption32 20 Rule1 ON button1 # state = 3 DO publish cmnd / topicHOLD / power 2 ENDON ON button1 # state = 2 DO publish cmnd / topicSINGLEPRESS / power 2 ENDON Rule1 1 Disable switch single press and use long press ~ SetOption11 0 Switches do not have double press feature [assuming a connected pushbutton configured as Switch1] single press: Does nothing (empty Delay commands) hold 2 secs: Toggle Power1 Backlog SwitchTopic1 0 ; SwitchMode1 5 ; SetOption32 20 Rule1 ON Switch1 # State = 3 DO Power1 2 ENDON ON Switch1 # State = 2 DO Delay ENDON Rule1 1 Execute several commands when a Timer expires ~ The default Timer1..16 functionality allows for controlling one output to either off, on, toggle or blink. When rules are enabled the blink option will be replaced by rule functionality allowing much more flexibility. Configure timer5 for rule execution when activated: Timer5 { \"Arm\" : 1 , \"Mode\" : 0 , \"Time\" : \"16:00\" , \"Days\" : \"1111111\" , \"Repeat\" : 1 , \"Action\" : 3 } Rule Rule1 ON clock # Timer = 5 DO Backlog Power2 on ; Power1 off ; Power3 2 ENDON Result When the timer expires the rule kicks in and set Power1 to OFF, Power2 to ON and Power3 TOGGLE. If you want to have blink functionality define a rule like ON clock#Timer=5 DO power 3 ENDON Setting variables ~ Demonstrate the use of variables. Make sure to execute commands Rule 4 (Disable one-shot detection) first when trying the following example. Set a variable Rule ON event # setvar1 DO var1 % value % ENDON Command: event setvar1=1 View a variable rule ON event # getvar1 DO var1 ENDON Command: event getvar1 Toggle a variable Rule ON event # togglevar1 DO event toggling1 =% var1 % ENDON ON event # toggling1 < 1 DO event setvar1 = 1 ENDON ON event # toggling1 > 0 DO event setvar1 = 0 ENDON ON event # setvar1 DO var1 % value % ENDON Command: event togglevar1 Show Messages: Rule ON event # message DO publish stat / [ topic ] / log % value % ENDON Command: event message=INIT All event commands can be executed from: console: event anyname=number mqtt: cmnd/[topic]/event anyname=number Everything together: Rule1 ON event # togglevar1 DO event toggling1 =% var1 % ENDON ON event # toggling1 < 1 DO event setvar1 = 1 ENDON ON event # toggling1 > 0 DO event setvar1 = 0 ENDON ON event # setvar1 DO var1 % value % ENDON ON event # getvar1 DO var1 ENDON ON event # message DO publish stat / mqttTopic / log % value % ENDON The following won't work: Rule1 ON event#setvar1 DO Backlog var1 %value%; Power1 %var1% ENDON At least not as you probably would expect. The var1 value used by the Power1 command will be the value present before the Backlog command is executed. This is so, because the rule will replace %var1% BEFORE the Backlog commands are put in the Backlog command stream. Time-delayed Auto-off Switch ~ Rule Rule1 ON button1 # state DO Backlog Power1 % value % ; RuleTimer1 600 ENDON ON Rules # Timer = 1 DO Power1 off ENDON Result on button1#state do Backlog Power1 %value%; On Button press the Light will toggle on/off RuleTimer1 600 ENDON Additionally RuleTimer1 will begin to countdown 10 minutes ON Rules#Timer=1 DO Power1 off ENDON After the RuleTimer1 expires the light will be turned off (if you forgot to turn it off) Time-delay After Switch Off ~ Rule Backlog switchmode1 1 ; rule1 1 Rule1 ON switch1 # state = 1 DO Backlog Power1 on ; ruletimer1 0 ENDON ON switch1 # state = 0 DO ruletimer1 300 ENDON ON rules # timer = 1 DO Power1 0 ENDON Result ruletimer1 300 sets a 5 minute timer. After that time, fan will be switched off. If during the defined 5 minutes (or in general - when timer is counting) you the switch on, the timer will be canceled. switchmode1 1 sets the switch in follow mode (LOW=off, HIGH=on) If you have inverted switch (LOW=on, HIGH=off) then use switchmode1 2 Auto-off Motion Sense Switch ~ Example works fine on a Wemos D1 Mini. Used as night light with motion sensor or as ambient light on floor or kitchen. Connect an LED Strip WS2812 on D1 and the PIR on D2 and a LDR on A0 (voltage divider with 10k ohm resistor) SwitchMode1 1 Rule Rule1 ON analog # a0 < 400 DO Backlog Rule3 0 ; Rule2 1 ENDON ON analog # a0 > 500 DO Backlog Rule2 0 ; Rule3 1 ENDON Rule2 ON switch1 # state DO Backlog Power1 1 ; RuleTimer1 30 ENDON ON Rules # Timer = 1 DO Power1 off ENDON Rule3 ON switch1 # state DO Power1 off ENDON Activate Rule1 with one shot detection Backlog Rule1 1; Rule1 6 Optional Backlog Rule2 4; Rule3 4 Result on analog#a0>400 disable Rule3 and activate Rule2 on analog#a0>500 disable Rule2 and activate Rule3 Rule2 activates the LEDs for RuleTimer1 30 seconds on each trigger from PIR the RuleTimer start again. on Rules#Timer=1 do Power1 off The LEDs turn off after the RuleTimer expires Rule3 is active on daylight and pipe the PIR signal in a Power1 off signal. The LEDs stay off. Control Timers from a Switch ~ Assuming that your switch is on GPIO00 and configured as Switch1 : Switchmode1 1 will make Switch1#state be 1 when ON and 0 when OFF If you don't set Switchmode1 or it is equal 0, it will only have Switch1#state=2 (toggle) and the rule will not work. Rule Rule1 ON Switch1 # state = 1 DO Timers 0 ENDON ON Switch1 # state = 0 DO Timers 1 ENDON Toggle Relay when holding button for 2 seconds ~ The following example is to explain how to catch and use the HOLD feature for buttons. Behavior: Disable Button1 Short Press and Toggle Relay1 only when holding button1 for 2 Seconds. Backlog ButtonTopic 0 ; SetOption1 1 ; SetOption32 20 Rule1 ON button1 # state = 3 DO Power1 2 ENDON ON button1 # state = 2 DO delay ENDON Rule1 1 Commands Explanation ButtonTopic 0 : (default) To not use topics for buttons SetOption1 1 : Allow only single, double and hold press button actions SetOption32 20 : Set key hold time from 0.1 to 10 seconds (20 = 2 seconds) Rule ON button1#state=3 DO Power1 2 ENDON : When holding the button1 for 2 seconds it will toggle relay 1 (state = 3 means HOLD) ON button1#state=2 DO delay ENDON : Do nothing when short pressing the button1 (state = 2 means TOGGLE) Rule1 1 : To enable rules NOTE: There is no state value for \"double press\" for Buttons. It is designed that double press will toggle the relay. See Multi-Press Functions for more information. In the case you do not want the double press feature you can configure your button as switch and also set SwitchMode that fits your use case (such as SwitchMode 5 to make the switch behave like a pushbutton) [SWITCH does not support double press] Another example but using switch instead of button: Backlog SwitchTopic1 0 ; SwitchMode1 5 ; SetOption32 20 Rule1 ON switch1 # state = 3 DO Power1 2 ENDON ON switch1 # state = 2 DO delay ENDON Rule1 1 Make sure Light is on at night ~ Using Timers, you can set a light to turn on and off to illuminate a street/patio by night. But if the device has no power at the trigger time, then, when it powers up, the light will be off all night. So, as a fail-safe, implement a conditional control to be checked at Tasmota Startup. Set Timers to turn on your light at Sunset and Turn off at sunrise. Use poweronstate 0 in order to start with lights off when powering up your device. Set the following rules: Rule1 ON Time # Initialized DO Backlog event checksunrise =% time % ; event checksunset =% time % ENDON ON event # checksunset >% sunset % DO Power1 1 ENDON ON event # checksunrise <% sunrise % DO Power1 1 ENDON The previous rules are conditionals that represent the following logic: IF %time%>%sunset DO Power1 1 / IF %time%<%sunrise DO Power1 1 Turn On Light Before Dawn and At Dusk ~ Turn on light at dusk until your nighttime and again in the morning before dawn. What if the sun sets after your nighttime, as in during the summer? Then the timer will turn off the light at \"night\", but then the Sunset timer will turn it on again, so it stays on all night. Rule Rule1 ON Time # Initialized DO event chkSun ENDON ON Time # Minute =% sunset % DO event chkSun ENDON ON Time # Minute =% mem2 % DO event chkSun ENDON ON Time # Minute =% sunrise % DO event chkSun ENDON ON Time # Minute =% mem1 % DO event chkSun ENDON Rule2 ON event # chkSun DO Backlog var1 0 ; event chkSunrise =% time % ; event chkSunset =% time % ; event chkmorn =% time % ; event chknight =% time % ; event setPower ENDON ON event # chkSunrise <% sunrise % DO var1 1 ENDON ON event # chkSunset >=% sunset % DO var1 1 ENDON ON event # chkmorn <% mem1 % DO var1 0 ENDON ON event # chknight >=% mem2 % DO var1 0 ENDON ON event # setPower DO Power1 % var1 % ENDON Backlog mem1 360 ; mem2 1350 ; Rule1 1 ; Rule2 1 Result When device restarts, calculate if the light should be on or off ON Time#Initialized DO event chkSun ENDON Calculate if the light should be on or off ON Time#Minute=%sunset% DO event chkSun ENDON ON Time#Minute=%mem2% DO event chkSun ENDON ON Time#Minute=%sunrise% DO event chkSun ENDON ON Time#Minute=%mem1% DO event chkSun ENDON Calculate if the light should be on or off on event#chkSun do Backlog Assume off var1 0; Trigger each event with the current time event chkSunrise=%time%; event chkSunset=%time%; event chkmorn=%time%; event chknight=%time%; event setPower End rule ENDON If before sunrise, turn on ON event#chkSunrise<%sunrise% DO var1 1 ENDON If past sunset, turn on ON event#chkSunset>=%sunset% DO var1 1 ENDON But if before Morning time ( mem1 ), do not turn on ON event#chkmorn<%mem1% DO var1 0 ENDON Or if after Night time ( mem2 ), do not turn on ON event#chknight>=%mem2% DO var1 0 ENDON Perform on/off state ON event#setPower DO Power1 %var1% ENDON Set variables for Morning (06h00) and Night (22h30) times Backlog mem1 360; mem2 1350 Turn on the rule sets Backlog Rule1 1; Rule2 1 Enable a PIR Switch only at night ~ Latitude and Longitude need to be set in config.

This switch toggles a lamp ON or OFF. The switch should work as below: i) during daytime (sunrise-sunset): ON when it is too dark (<150 lx) and OFF when it gets brighter (>175 lx). ii) during evenings it ignores the sensor and turns on at sunset and turns off after about 5 hours Approach: Used a combination of Clock Timers and Rule to do this. Timer 1: Power ON switch at Sunset Powers on the switch at sunset with an offset of 20 minutes. Repeats every day. Timer1 { \"Arm\" : 1 , \"Mode\" : 2 , \"Time\" : \"-00:20\" , \"Window\" : 0 , \"Days\" : \"1111111\" , \"Repeat\" : 1 , \"Output\" : 1 , \"Action\" : 1 } Timer 2: Power OFF switch at Night. Turns power OFF at 23.00hrs. Repeats every day. Timer2 { \"Arm\" : 1 , \"Mode\" : 0 , \"Time\" : \"23:00\" , \"Window\" : 0 , \"Days\" : \"1111111\" , \"Repeat\" : 1 , \"Output\" : 1 , \"Action\" : 0 } Timer 3: Trigger Luminance Rule at Sunrise Start watching the Lux sensor 15 minutes after sunrise. Timer3 { \"Arm\" : 1 , \"Mode\" : 1 , \"Time\" : \"00:15\" , \"Window\" : 0 , \"Days\" : \"1111111\" , \"Repeat\" : 1 , \"Output\" : 1 , \"Action\" : 3 } Rule 1: Main Rule to check Luminance If Luminance is less than 150lx, power ON. If it goes beyond 175lx, power OFF.

If you do press the switch twice in a rapid succession (i.e., double-click), you can trigger a different action (e.g., on a remote device). Enable or disable relay with a switch in Domoticz ~ When you want to send MQTT messages ( we use domoticz in this example ) and choose when you want the relay on or off, by simply sending HTTP commands to trigger an event. Initial Config: PushButton Doorbell (Sonoff Basic R1) GPIO14 - Switch4 (12) Connect the Switch to GND and the GPIO on your device. Be sure put a 4.7k resistor between VCC(3.3v) and the GPIO. This prevents ghost switching (capacitor is optional) See: YouTube Dont forget to change the IDX value Commands: Backlog SwitchTopic 0 ; SwitchMode4 2 ; SetOption0 0 ; PowerOnState 0 var1 1 Rule1 ON event # doorbell DO var1 % value % ENDON ON switch4 # state = 1 DO publish domoticz / in { \"idx\" : 11 , \"nvalue\" : 1 } ENDON ON switch4 # state = 1 DO Power1 % var1 % ENDON ON switch4 # state = 0 DO publish domoticz / in { \"idx\" : 11 , \"nvalue\" : 0 } ENDON ON switch4 # state = 0 DO Power1 0 ENDON Rule1 1 Usage: Turn off the relay by calling the event using HTTP: http://<tasmotaIP>/cm?cmnd=event%20doorbell=0 Turn on the relay by calling the event using HTTP: http://<tasmotaIP>/cm?cmnd=event%20doorbell=1 If your Tasmota device is password protected, which is most common, then use the following HTTP commands instead. Make sure you change <tasmotaUsername> and <tasmotaPassword> Off: http://<tasmotaIP>/cm?&user=<tasmotaUsername>&password=<tasmotaPassword>&cmnd=event%20doorbell=0 On: http://<tasmotaIP>/cm?&user=<tasmotaUsername>&password=<tasmotaPassword>&cmnd=event%20doorbell=1 Force automatic re-connection to MQTT server via SD DNS ~ In order to search for the MQTT server using SD-DNS service (a.k.a. Bonjour or Zero Network Configuration) the suggested configuration is to leave the MQTT Host field blank. The standard behavior of Tasmota is searches for _mqtt._tcp service resolve that to the proper IP address connect to it in case the connection is successful, retain the IP address and use that in the subsequent connections The above is not proper, though, in case you have a redundant MQTT (e.g., two MQTT server synchronized). In such case, when the active MQTT fails for any reason, the expected behavior is to achieve automatic re-connection to the other MQTT server. That can be easily configured defining the following rule on the device console: Rule1 ON Mqtt # Disconnected DO MqttHost 0 ENDON Rule1 1 If the MqttHost field already contains an IP, you have to delete it using the web interface or the following MQTT command: mosquitto_pub -h mqtt_server.local -t \"cmnd/mqttTopic/MqttHost\" -m '' Change distance to percentage ~ When measuring distance and you have the need to see it in percentage of distance.

SwitchMode1 1 will make Switch1#state to be 1 when ON and 0 when OFF SwitchMode1 1 SwitchMode2 1 will make Switch2#state to be 1 when ON and 0 when OFF SwitchMode2 1 Publish json with key POWER1 and value %value% Rule1 ON switch1 # state DO publish stat / wemos - 4 / RESULT { \"POWER1\" : \"%value%\" } ENDON Publish json with key POWER2 and value %value% Rule2 ON switch2 # state DO publish stat / wemos - 4 / RESULT { \"POWER2\" : \"%value%\" } ENDON Enable Rules Backlog Rule1 1; Rule2 1 Output: RUL : SWITCH1 # STATE performs \"publish stat/wemos-4/RESULT {\" POWER1 \":\" 1 \"}\" MQT : stat /wemos-4/ RESULT = { \"POWER1\" : \"1\" } RUL : SWITCH2 # STATE performs \"publish stat/wemos-4/RESULT {\" POWER2 \":\" 1 \"}\" MQT : stat /wemos-4/ RESULT = { \"POWER2\" : \"1\" } RUL : SWITCH1 # STATE performs \"publish stat/wemos-4/RESULT {\" POWER1 \":\" 0 \"}\" MQT : stat /wemos-4/ RESULT = { \"POWER1\" : \"0\" } RUL : SWITCH2 # STATE performs \"publish stat/wemos-4/RESULT {\" POWER2 \":\" 0 \"}\" MQT : stat /wemos-4/ RESULT = { \"POWER2\" : \"0\" } RUL : SWITCH1 # STATE performs \"publish stat/wemos-4/RESULT {\" POWER1 \":\" 1 \"}\" MQT : stat /wemos-4/ RESULT = { \"POWER1\" : \"1\" } RUL : SWITCH1 # STATE performs \"publish stat/wemos-4/RESULT {\" POWER1 \":\" 0 \"}\" MQT : stat /wemos-4/ RESULT = { \"POWER1\" : \"0\" } Receiving state of anything that triggers SWITCH more than one time ~ With analog intercom doorbells you can take out info about ringing from speaker voltage. You can connect GPIO to it via opto-isolator and resistor to take out state. But even with those speaker voltage is dropping so it switches the device multiple times. MQT : cmnd /doorbell/ POWER2 = OFF ( retained ) MQT : cmnd /doorbell/ POWER2 = ON ( retained ) MQT : cmnd /doorbell/ POWER2 = OFF ( retained ) MQT : cmnd /doorbell/ POWER2 = ON ( retained ) MQT : cmnd /doorbell/ POWER2 = OFF ( retained ) To solve it we can use rules.

Prevent Wemos D1 mini load overcurrent ~ As a WS2812 24 led ring draws approximately 24x3x20 mA = 1.44A and the Wemos D1 mini powered from a PC's USB port can only provide up to 0.5A it would be nice to have some kind of mechanism in place to limit the amount of current to the WS2812 LEDring to 0.1A. This is still enough to light all 24 leds up to color 202020.

Using dummy GPIO to send Serial codes to an MCU ~ By having a device that controls all its features through an MCU and reports the states in serial codes to the ESP8266 we have to create some rules to control it using the Web UI or standard Power commands. Rule1 ON Power1 # state = 1 DO serialsend5 55 AA00060005020400010213 ENDON ON Power1 # state = 0 DO serialsend5 55 AA00060005020400010011 ENDON ON Power2 # state = 1 DO serialsend5 55 AA00060005060400010217 ENDON ON Power2 # state = 0 DO serialsend5 55 AA00060005060400010015 ENDON Power1 controls the device, Power2 turn on and off the light on the device. Another rule was created to issue commands on boot so the serial interface works every time and to control the built in fan using Event triggers and have its state retained in an MQTT message for Home Assistant.

BREAK will stop the execution for the triggers that follow. If a trigger that ends with BREAK fires, then the following triggers of that rule will not be executed. This allows to simulate IF..ELSEIF..ELSE..ENDIF Example: IF temp > 85 then VAR1 more85 ELSEIF temp > 83 then VAR1 more83 ELSEIF temp > 81 then VAR1 more81 ELSEIF temp = 81 then VAR1 equal81 ELSE VAR1 less81 ENDIF With the actual rules, if we use a set like the following: Rule1 ON event # temp > 85 DO VAR1 more85 ENDON ON event # temp > 83 DO VAR1 more83 ENDON ON event # temp > 81 DO VAR1 more81 ENDON ON event # temp = 81 DO VAR1 equal81 ENDON ON event # temp < 81 DO VAR1 less81 ENDON This is the output in the console: CMD : rule MQT : stat /living/ RESULT = { \"Rule1\" : \"ON\" , \"Once\" : \"ON\" , \"StopOnError\" : \"OFF\" , \"Free\" : 322 , \"Rules\" : \"ON event#temp>85 do VAR1 more85 ENDON ON event#temp>83 do VAR1 more83 ENDON on event#temp>81 do VAR1 more81 ENDON on event#temp=81 do VAR1 equal81 ENDON on event#temp<81 DO VAR1 less81 ENDON\" } CMD : event temp = 10 MQT : stat /living/ RESULT = { \"Event\" : \"Done\" } RUL : EVENT # TEMP < 81 performs \"VAR1 less81\" MQT : stat /living/ RESULT = { \"Var1\" : \"less81\" } CMD : event temp = 100 MQT : stat /living/ RESULT = { \"Event\" : \"Done\" } RUL : EVENT # TEMP > 85 performs \"VAR1 more85\" MQT : stat /living/ RESULT = { \"Var1\" : \"more85\" } RUL : EVENT # TEMP > 83 performs \"VAR1 more83\" MQT : stat /living/ RESULT = { \"Var1\" : \"more83\" } RUL : EVENT # TEMP > 81 performs \"VAR1 more81\" MQT : stat /living/ RESULT = { \"Var1\" : \"more81\" } So, all the triggers where TEMP>100, are firing. With the BREAK statement the rule set can be changed to: Rule on event # temp > 85 do VAR1 more85 break on event # temp > 83 do VAR1 more83 break ON event # temp > 81 DO VAR1 more81 ENDON ON event # temp = 81 DO VAR1 equal81 ENDON ON event # temp < 81 DO VAR1 less81 ENDON Which will result in the following output: CMD : rule RSL : RESULT = { \"Rule1\" : \"ON\" , \"Once\" : \"OFF\" , \"StopOnError\" : \"OFF\" , \"Free\" : 321 , \"Rules\" : \"ON event#temp>85 do VAR1 more85 break ON event#temp>83 do VAR1 more83 break on event#temp>81 do VAR1 more81 ENDON on event#temp=81 do VAR1 equal81 ENDON on event#temp<81 DO VAR1 less81 ENDON\" } CMD : event temp = 10 RSL : RESULT = { \"Event\" : \"Done\" } RUL : EVENT # TEMP < 81 performs \"VAR1 less81\" RSL : RESULT = { \"Var1\" : \"less81\" } CMD : event temp = 100 RSL : RESULT = { \"Event\" : \"Done\" } RUL : EVENT # TEMP > 85 performs \"VAR1 more85\" RSL : RESULT = { \"Var1\" : \"more85\" } CMD : event temp = 83 RSL : RESULT = { \"Event\" : \"Done\" } RUL : EVENT # TEMP > 81 performs \"VAR1 more81\" RSL : RESULT = { \"Var1\" : \"more81\" } Adjust PowerDelta according to current Power values ~ Power sensor reporting thresholds are set by a percentage change in the Power value by setting PowerDelta . Power changes from 10W to 11W (10%) may not be very interesting. But power changes from 1000W to 1100W (also 10%) could be very important. To avoid getting reports for small changes but ensuring that larger power swings are reported, a rule set can be used to create a gradient threshold based on the absolute power values. This rule also uses the one-shot feature of rules to avoid reporting of every small change within a threshold window. The rule (a ON/DO/ENDON rule in this the set) will trigger only once when a threshold is crossed.

This rules simulates pressing the button three times to set the receiving device to the third speed setting. Specify the rule set The <trigger> can be a a condition or an event sent from another device or home automation hub. <topic> corresponds to the device transmitting the code (e.g., YTF IR Bridge ).

The master performs the switching of the power to the lights, while the slave just asks the master to toggle the power state. The master also turns the slave's relays on and off so that the LED indicators follow the master's state. Using the WebSend command, the two switches can talk to each other without an MQTT broker. It remains to be seen how reliable this is. Starting with the slave, the rule to toggle the master is pretty simple: Rule1 ON Event # sendPower DO WebSend [ 192.168 . 0.74 ] POWER % value % TOGGLE ENDON ON Button1 # State DO Event sendPower = 1 ENDON ON Button2 # State DO Event sendPower = 2 ENDON ON Button3 # State DO Event sendPower = 3 ENDON Rule1 1 Note that having a rule for the Button#State disables the power toggling of the slave's relay(s). This is desirable because we want the master to control the slave's relay state(s) according to its own as follows: Rule1 ON Event # sendPower DO WebSend [ 192.168 . 0.144 ] POWER % Var1 % % value % ENDON ON Power1 # state DO Backlog Var1 1 ; Event sendPower =% value % ENDON ON Power2 # state DO Backlog Var1 2 ; Event sendPower =% value % ENDON ON Power3 # state DO Backlog Var1 3 ; Event sendPower =% value % ENDON Rule1 1 Roller shutter push-button toggle ~ With a two relay device (e.g., Shelly 2.5) configured for a roller shutter, you can also connect push-buttons (configured as switch components in this example) and set them for inverted toggle behavior. Pressing a push-button once makes the roller shutter move in one direction. Pressing it again stops it. These rules each use a variable to remember the shutter state where 0 == Stopped and 1 == Moving . Backlog SwitchTopic 0 ; SwitchMode1 4 ; SwitchMode2 4 Rule1 ON Switch1 # State == 1 DO Add1 1 ENDON ON Var1 # State == 0 DO ShutterStop1 ENDON ON Var1 # State == 1 DO ShutterClose1 ENDON ON Var1 # State >= 2 DO Var1 0 ENDON ON Shutter1 # Close DO Var1 0 ENDON ON Switch2 # State == 1 DO Add2 1 ENDON ON Var2 # State == 0 DO ShutterStop1 ENDON ON Var2 # State == 1 DO ShutterOpen1 ENDON ON Var2 # State >= 2 DO Var2 0 ENDON ON Shutter1 # Open DO Var2 0 ENDON Rule1 1 Control a dimmer with one switch ~ This example is for GPIOs defined as switches not buttons Activate dimmer mode with Switchmode 11 and shorten long press time to 1 second ( Setoption32 10 ). A short press of the switch sends a TOGGLE message to toggle the dimmer. A long press sends repeated INC_DEC messages to increment the dimmer. If a second press of the switch follows the first press a INV message is sent to invert the function from increment to decrement and repeatet INC_DEC messages are sent to decrement the dimmer. After releasing the switch a timeout message CLEAR resets the automation Backlog SwitchMode 5 ; SetOption32 20 Rule1 on system # boot mem1 + ENDON ON switch1 # state = 2 DO publish light / cmnd / POWER TOGGLE ENDON ON switch1 # state = 4 DO publish light / cmnd / DIMMER % mem1 % ENDON ON switch1 # state = 5 DO mem1 - ENDON ON switch1 # state = 6 DO mem1 + ENDON Rule1 1 Notice we use Rule which edits Rule1 rule set. They can be used interchangeably. Watchdog for Wi-Fi router ~ A Tasmota socket can ping a remote host (router itself or something else connected to the router) and power cycle the socket to reboot the router. In this example, ping interval of 3 minutes is used. The simplest watchdog rule does not use variables: Rule1 ON Time # Minute | 3 DO Ping4 192.168 . 1.10 ENDON ON Ping # 192.168 . 1.10 # Success == 0 DO Backlog Power1 0 ; Delay 10 ; Power1 1 ; ENDON Rule1 1 However, if the router becomes unreachable for a long time, the watchdog will keep cycling it every three minutes. This could reduce the watchdog's relay lifetime to months, at most years. Safer option would be to use an exponential backoff algorithm. Var1 contains the current ping interval in minutes, which is trippled after each failed ping, but limited to 1439 minutes (1 day). Rule1 ON system # boot do Var1 3 ENDON ON Var1 # State > 1439 DO Var1 1439 ENDON ON Time # Minute |% var1 % DO Ping4 192.168 . 1.10 ENDON ON Ping # 192.168 . 1.10 # Success == 0 DO backlog Mult1 3 ; Power1 0 ; Delay 10 ; Power1 1 ENDON ON Ping # 192.168 . 1.10 # Success > 0 DO Var1 3 ENDON This requires #define USE_PING and Tasmota version 8.2.0.3 or newer Simple Thermostat Example ~ As example, to be used on a Sonoff TH10 with Sensor Si7021 This example turn on and off an output based on the temperature value and the upper set point and the lower set point. It waits until is enabled by pressing the button or by mqtt message 1 to mem1. This value is remembered. So if power cycle occurs, will resume operation. The set point values can be changed on the fly by mqtt or console commands If the Temperature sensor disconnects, the outputs will shutdown until the sensor is back again and will resume operation. When the device is power up, the thermostat also waits until the sensor value to resume operation. Initial Config: Available physical button as Switch1 Relay1 will be used the controller Rules must be used to control Relay so the pushbutton must only control Switch1 and not directly control the relay - For this we use SwitchMode1 3 as described below and create the necessary rules because the pushbutton control of the relay is only disabled when the rules are in place. Initial config on console: SwitchMode1 3 <- Use the switch1 as pushbutton (It will allow us to disable the link between the button and the relay by inserting a rule to dictate what the pushbutton will do - NOTE: Until rules are created the pushbutton will still control the relay! ) Rule1 1 <- turn on rules Rule1 4 <- turn off one-shot rule TelePeriod 60 <- check temp every minute SetOption26 1 <- use Power1 on mqtt messages SetOption0 0 <- dont save relay status on eeprom PowerOnState 0 <- start all relays off Mem1 0 <- thermostat status: 0-off 1-enabled - View or set by MQTT cmnd/mqttTopic/mem1 Mem2 25 <- setpoint Temp upper limit - View or set by MQTT cmnd/mqttTopic/mem2 Mem3 23 <- setpoint Temp lower limit - View or set by MQTT cmnd/mqttTopic/mem3 Var1 0 <- thermostat actual status: 1-OK 0-NOT READY - View by MQTT cmnd/mqttTopic/var1 Rules On boot start a watchdog timer to check temp sensor connection.

When the sun is shining, the pump should push water through the solar panel, to heat the pool. When it's night or cloudy, the pump should be off, to avoid cooling the pool water through the solar panel. The pump is controlled by a Sonoff TH10 with 2x DS18B20 sensors connected. 3 rules: Pump should start when solar panel is more than 2 deg warmer than the pool water Pump should stop when solar panel is less than 1 deg warmer than the pool water Pump should not start if the solar panel is below 25 deg Celsius. t1 : pool temp t2 : panel temp var1 : in valid panel temp range? var2 : off threshold temp for panel var3 : on threshold temp for panel mem3 : lowest valid panel temp mem3 25 rule1 ON DS18B20 - 1 # temperature DO event t1 =% value % ENDON ON DS18B20 - 2 # temperature DO event t2 =% value % ENDON ON event # t2 >% mem3 % DO var1 1 ENDON ON event # t2 <=% mem3 % DO var1 0 ENDON ON event # t1 DO Backlog var2 % value % ; add2 1 ENDON ON event # t1 DO Backlog var3 % value % ; add3 2 ENDON ON event # t2 >% var3 % DO Power1 % var1 % ENDON ON event # t2 <% var2 % DO Power1 0 ENDON To test the rule without having the sensors in place, simply enter the events for t1 and t2 in the console: Backlog event t1=21;event t2=30 And watch the relay turn on and off based on the values.

Energy Saving Switch ~ Example of a switch controlling a light with a condition of a required amount of lux. When the switch is on, the light will turn on but only when you have less than 100 lux in that room. While if the switch is off the light will be off. Rule1 ON switch1 # state = 1 DO var1 100 ENDON ON switch1 # state = 0 DO Backlog var1 0 ; Power1 off ENDON ON APDS9960 # Ambient <% var1 % DO Power1 on ENDON Use of variables and tele- in Domoticz ~ Using variables allows for storing sensor results to be used in composing a single HA message like used with Domoticz. To prevent flooding Domoticz with messages we only want to send a message at TelePeriod time. This is achieved by prefixing the <SensorName> with the label tele- . This example will use a variable storing the temperature to be used together with humidity in one Domoticz MQTT message. Domoticz configured with a virtual sensor Temp+Hum using Idx 134 Rule Rule ON tele - am2301 - 12 # temperature DO var1 % value % ENDON ON tele - am2301 - 12 # humidity DO publish domoticz / in { \"idx\" : 134 , \"svalue\" : \"%var1%;%value%;1\" } ENDON Result - As a result of the tele- prefix the rules will be checked at TelePeriod time for sensor AM2301-12 Temperature and Humidity. The first rule will use the Temperature stored in %value% and save it in %var1% for future use. The second rule will use the Humidity stored in %value% and the Temperature stored in %var1% to compose a single MQTT message suitable for Domoticz. RF Repeater / IR Repeater ~ In some applications, an RF-Repeater may come in handy to increase the range of RF based devices. We need to use RF reciever and RF transmitter modules with tasmota powered controllers. The following rule looks for data received by the RF receiver and re transmits the same over the transmitter. Rule1 on RfReceived # data do Rfsend { \"Data\" :% value % , \"Bits\" : 24 , \"Protocol\" : 1 , \"Pulse\" : 454 } endon Enable it with Rule1 1 A similar concept can also work for IR- Repeater. Connect IR receiver module and IR trnasmitter to Tasmotized device and the following rule retransmits any data over IR Rule1 on IrReceived # Data do IRsend { \"Protocol\" : \"NEC\" , \"Bits\" : 32 , \"Data\" :% value % } endon Enable it with Rule1 1 The only catch is that the protocol needs to be setup in the rule. Most likely this can be taken care of by using a more complex rule maybe using variables.

It can be followed by another rule. BREAK - marks the end of a rule. BREAK will stop the execution of the remaining rules that follow this rule within the rule set. If a rule that ends with BREAK is triggered, the following rules in that rule set will not be executed. This allows the rules to somewhat simulate an \"IF/ELSE\" statement. Rule sets are defined by using the Rule<x> command. After defining a rule set, you have to enable it (turn it on) using Rule<x> 1 . Similarly you can disable the rule set using Rule<x> 0 . Note If bootloops are detected all rules will be disabled as a precaution. See SetOption36 . There are three separate rule sets called Rule1 , Rule2 and Rule3 . Each rule set can contain many rules which are dynamically compressed. Number of rules that can fit in a rule set varies. Expect at least 1000 characters available per rule set. Whenever a rule set is enabled all the rules in it will be active. If the character count of the rules in one set actually exceeds the limit, start using the next rule set. If you have a long list of rules, verify the rules have all fit by inspecting the resulting log. Rules inside a rule set Rule<x> are concatenated and entered as a single statement. Rule < x > ON < trigger1 > DO < command > ENDON ON < trigger2 > DO < command > ENDON ... Spaces after ON , around DO , and before ENDON or BREAK are mandatory.

Feature Description USE_BUTTON_EVENT enable >b section (detect button state changes) USE_SCRIPT_JSON_EXPORT enable >J section (publish JSON payload on TelePeriod ) USE_SCRIPT_SUB_COMMAND enables invoking named script subroutines via the Console or MQTT USE_SCRIPT_HUE enable >H section (Alexa Hue emulation) USE_SCRIPT_STATUS enable >U section (receive JSON payloads from cmd status) SCRIPT_POWER_SECTION enable >P section (execute on power changes) SUPPORT_MQTT_EVENT enables support for subscribe unsubscribe USE_SENDMAIL enable >m section and support for sending e-mail USE_SCRIPT_WEB_DISPLAY enable >W section (modify web UI) SCRIPT_FULL_WEBPAGE enable >w section (seperate full web page and webserver) USE_TOUCH_BUTTONS enable virtual touch button support with touch displays USE_WEBSEND_RESPONSE enable receiving the response of a WebSend command (received in section >E) SCRIPT_STRIP_COMMENTS enables stripping comments when attempting to paste a script that is too large to fit USE_ANGLE_FUNC add sin(x),acos(x) and sqrt(x) e.g. to allow calculation of horizontal cylinder volume USE_24C256 enables use of 24C256 I 2 C EEPROM to expand script buffer (defaults to 4k) USE_SCRIPT_FATFS enables SD card support (on SPI bus). Specify the CS pin number. Also enables 4k script buffer on ESP8266 if using device with 4 or more Mb can enable FS by specifying -1 (using linker files with enabled FS Buffer e.g. eagle.flash.4m1m.ld) USE_SCRIPT_FATFS_EXT enables additional FS commands SDCARD_DIR enables support for web UI for SD card directory upload and download USE_WEBCAM enables support ESP32 Webcam which is controlled by scripter cmds USE_FACE_DETECT enables face detecting in ESP32 Webcam USE_SCRIPT_TASK enables multitasking Task in ESP32 USE_SCRIPT_GLOBVARS enables global variables and >G section USE_SML_M enables Smart Meter Interface SML_REPLACE_VARS enables posibility to replace the lines from the (SML) descriptor with Vars USE_SML_SCRIPT_CMD enables SML script cmds USE_SCRIPT_TIMER enables up to 4 timers SCRIPT_GET_HTTPS_JP enables reading HTTPS JSON WEB Pages (e.g. Tesla Powerwall) LARGE_ARRAYS enables arrays of up to 1000 entries instead of max 127 SCRIPT_LARGE_VNBUFF enables to use 4096 in stead of 256 bytes buffer for variable names LITTLEFS_SCRIPT_SIZE S enables script buffer of size S (e.g.4096) USE_GOOGLE_CHARTS enables defintion of google charts within web section USE_DSIPLAY_DUMP enables to show epaper screen as BMP image in >w section ---- Scripting Language for Tasmota is an alternative to Tasmota Rules To enter a script, go to Configuration - Edit script in the Tasmota web UI menu The maximum script size is 1535 bytes (uses rule set buffers). If the pasted script is larger than 1535 characters, comments will be stripped to attempt to make the script fit. To save code space almost no error messages are provided. However it is taken care of that at least it should not crash on syntax errors. Features ~ Up to 50 variables (45 numeric and 5 strings - this may be changed by setting a compilation #define directive) Freely definable variable names (all variable names are intentionally case sensitive ) Nested if,then,else up to a level of 8 Math operators + , - , * , / , % , & , | , ^ All operators may be used in the op= form, e.g., += Comparison operators == , != , > , >= , < , <= and , or support Hexadecimal numbers with prefix 0x are supported Strings support + and += operators Support for \\n \\r regular expressions on strings String comparison == , != String size is 19 characters (default). This can be increased or decreased by the optional parameter on the D section definition Script Interpreter Execution is strictly sequential , line by line Evaluation is left to right with optional brackets All numbers are float , e.g., temp=hum*(100/37.5)+temp-(timer*hum%10) No spaces are allowed between math operators Comments start with ; Script buffer size the script language normally shares script buffer with rules buffer which is 1536 chars. with below options script buffer size may be expanded. PVARS is size for permanant vars.

(mac and pc) you may use any number of comments and indents to make it better readable. then with cmd r the script is transfered to the ESP and immediately started. (all comments and indents are removed before transfering) see further info and download here Console Commands script <n> : 0 = switch script off; 1 = switch script on script ><cmdline> execute - Can be used to set variables, e.g., script >mintmp=15 - Multiple statements can be specified by separating each with a semicolon, e.g. script >mintmp=15;maxtemp=40 script?<var> queries a script variable var The script itself can't be specified because the size would not fit the MQTT buffers Script Sections ~ Section descriptors (e.g., >E ) are case sensitive a valid script must start with >D in the first line >D ssize ssize = optional max string size (default=19) define and init variables here, must be the first section, no other code allowed p:vname specifies permanent variables. The number of permanent variables is limited by Tasmota rules space (50 bytes) - numeric variables are 4 bytes; string variables are one byte longer than the length of string t:vname specifies countdown timers, if >0 they are decremented in seconds until zero is reached. see example below i:vname specifies auto increment counters if =0 (in seconds) g:vname specifies global variable which is linked to all global variables with the same defintion on all devices in the homenet. when a variable is updated in one device it is instantly updated in all other devices. if a section >G exists it is executed when a variable is updated from another device (this is done via UDP-multicast, so not always reliable) m:vname specifies a median filter variable with 5 entries (for elimination of outliers) M:vname specifies a moving average filter variable with 8 entries (for smoothing data) (max 5 filters in total m+M) optional another filter length (1..127) can be given after the definition. Filter vars can be accessed also in indexed mode vname[x] (x = 1..N , x = 0 returns current array index pointer, x = -1 returns arry lenght) Using this filter, vars can be used as arrays, #define LARGE_ARRAYS allows for arrays up to 1000 entries array may also be permanent by specifying an extra :p m:p:vname defines a permanent array. Keep in mind however that in 1M Flash standard configurations you only have 50 bytes permanent storage which stands for a maximum of 12 numbers. (see list above for permanent storage in other configurations) Tip Keep variable names as short as possible. The length of all variable names taken together may not exceed 256 characters. Memory is dynamically allocated as a result of the D section. Copying a string to a number or reverse is supported >B executed on BOOT time before sensors are initialized and on save script >BS executed on BOOT time after sensors are initialized >E Executed when a Tasmota MQTT RESULT message is received, e.g., on POWER change. Also Zigbee reports to this section. >F Executed every 100 ms >S Executed every second >R Executed on restart. p vars are saved automatically after this call >T Executed on TelePeriod time ( SENSOR and STATE ), only put tele- vars in this section Remark: json variable names (like all others) may not contain math operators like - , you should set SetOption64 1 to replace - ( dash ) with _ ( underscore ). Zigbee sensors will not report to this section, use E instead. >H Alexa Hue interface (up to 32 virtual hue devices) ( example ) device , type , onVars Remark: hue values have a range from 0-65535. Divide by 182 to assign HSBcolors hue values. device device name type device type - E = extended color; S = switch onVars assign Hue \"on\" extended color parameters for hue, saturation, brightness, and color temperature (hue,sat,bri,ct) to scripter variables Example lamp1,E,on=pwr1,hue=hue1,sat=sat1,bri=bri1,ct=ct1 >U JSON messages from cmd status arrive here >G global variable updated section >P any power change triggers here >jp https webpage json parse arrives here >ti1 >ti2 >ti3 >ti4 ticker callback after timer expiration >b (note lower case) executed on button state change bt[x] read button state (x = 1..

Requires compiling with #define USE_SCRIPT_JSON_EXPORT . >W The lines in this section are displayed in the web UI main page. Requires compiling with #define USE_SCRIPT_WEB_DISPLAY . You may put any html code here. Variables may be substituted using %var% HTML statements are displayed in the sensor section of the main page HTML statements preceded with a @ are displayed at the top of the page USER IO elements are displayed at the top of the page for next loops are supported to repeat HTML code (precede with % char) %for var from to inc %next script subroutines may be called sub=name of subroutine, like normal subroutines %=#sub in this subroutine a web line may be sent by wcs (see below) thus allowing dynamic HTML pages A web user interface may be generated containing any of the following elements: Button: bu(vn txt1 txt2) (up to 4 buttons may be defined in one row) vn = name of variable to hold button state txt1 = text of ON state of button txt2 = text of OFF state of button Checkbox: ck(vn txt) vn = name of variable to hold checkbox state txt = label text Slider: sl(min max vn ltxt mtxt rtxt) min = slider minimum value max = slider maximum value vn = name of variable to hold slider value ltxt = label left of slider mtxt = label middle of slider rtxt = label right of slider Text Input: tx(vn lbl) vn = name of string variable to hold text state lbl = label text Number Input: nm(min max step vn txt) min = number minimum value max = number maximum value step = number step value for up/down arrows vn = name of number variable to hold number txt = label text Google Charts: draws a google chart with up to 4 data sets per chart gc( T array1 ... array4 \"name\" \"label1\" ... \"label4\" \"entrylabels\" \"header\" {\"maxy1\"} {\"maxy2\"}) T = type - b=barchart - c=columnchart - C=combochart - p=piechart - l=linechart up to 4 lines with same scaling - l2=linechart with exactly 2 lines and 2 y scales (must be given at end) - lf2 like above but with splined lines - h=histogram - t=data table - g=simple gauges (must give extra 3 vars after header, yellow start, red start, maxval) - T=Timeline (special type arrays contains start,stop pairs in minutes timeofday) b,l,h type may have the '2' option to specify exactly 2 arrays with 2 y scales given at the end of paramter list. a very individual chart may be specified by splitting the chart definition and inserting the chart options directly see example below array = up to 4 arrays of data name = name of chart label = label for up to the 4 datasets in chart entrylabel = labels of each x axis entry separated by '|' char (\"cntN\" starts numbering entries with the number N an optional /X generates numbers devided by X) (\"wdh: before a week defintion generates a week with full hours) header = visible header name of chart additionally you have to define the html frame to put the chart in (both lines must be preceded by a $ char) e.g. $<div id=\"chart1\"style=\"width:640px;height:480px;margin:0 auto\"></div> $gc(c array1 array2 \"wr\" \"pwr1\" \"pwr2\" \"mo|di|mi|do|fr|sa|so\" \"Solar feed\") you may define more then one chart. The charts id is chart1 ... chartN very customized chart definition: define a chart like above, but add a t to the definition this generates a google table from the arrays e.g.: &gc(lt array1 array2 \"wr\" \"pwr1\" \"pwr2\" \"mo|di|mi|do|fr|sa|so\") then define the options for the graph as from the doku of google e.g.: $var options = { $vAxes:{0:{maxValue:40,title:'Au\u00dfentemperatur'},1:{maxValue:60,title:'Solarspeicher'}}, $series:{0:{targetAxisIndex:0},1:{targetAxisIndex:1}}, $hAxis: {title: 'Wochenverlauf'}, $}; then gc(e) closes the definition $gc(e) >w ButtonLabel generates a button with the name \"ButtonLabel\" in Tasmota main menu. Clicking this button displays a web page with the HTML data of this section. all cmds like in >W apply here. these lines are refreshed frequently to show e.g. sensor values. lines preceeded by $ are static and not refreshed and display below lines without $. this option also enables a full webserver interface when USE_SCRIPT_FATFS is activ. you may display files from the flash or SD filesystem by specifying the url: IP/sdc/path . (supported files: *.jpg, *.html, *.txt) Requires compiling with #define SCRIPT_FULL_WEBPAGE . >M Smart Meter Interface If a variable does not exist, ??? is displayed for commands If a Tasmota SENSOR or STATUS or RESULT message is not generated or a Var does not exist the destination variable is NOT updated. Special Variables ~ (read only) upsecs = seconds since start uptime = minutes since start time = minutes since midnight sunrise = sunrise minutes since midnight sunset = sunset minutes since midnight tper = TelePeriod ( may be set also ) tstamp = timestamp (local date and time) topic = mqtt topic gtopic = mqtt group topic lip = local ip as string luip = udp ip as string (from updating device when USE_SCRIPT_GLOBVARS defined) prefixn = prefix n = 1-3 pwr[x] = power state (x = 1..N) pc[x] = pulse counter value (x = 1..4) tbut[x] = touch screen button state (x = 1..N) sw[x] = switch state (x = 0..N) (Switch1 = sw[0] ) bt[x] = button state (x = 1..N) only valid in section b (if defined USE_BUTTON_EVENT) pin[x] = GPIO pin level (x = 0..16) pn[x] = GPIO for sensor code x. 99 if none pd[x] = defined sensor for GPIO x. 999 if none pl[path] = plays the mp3 path (ESP32 and if I2S Device defined) say[svar] = text to speach (if I2S Device defined) adc(fac (pin)) = get adc value (on ESP32 can select pin) fac is number of averaged samples (power of 2: 0..7) sht[x] = shutter position (x = 1..N) (if defined USE_SHUTTER) gtmp = global temperature ghum = global humidity gprs = global pressure pow(x y) = calculates exponential powers x^y med(n x) = calculates a 5 value median filter of x (2 filters possible n=0,1) int(x) = gets the integer part of x (like floor) hn(x) = converts x (0..255) to a hex nibble string hx(x) = converts x (0..65535) to a hex string hd(\"hstr\") = converts hex number string to a decimal number st(svar c n) = string token - retrieve the n th element of svar delimited by c sl(svar) = gets the length of a string asc(svar) = gets the binary value of 1. char of a string sb(svar p n) = gets a substring from svar at position p (if p<0 counts from end) and length n is(num \"string1|string2|....|stringn|\") = defines a string array optionally preset with immediate strings separated by '|' (this immediate string may be up to 255 chars long) num = 0 read only string array, num > 0 number of elements in read write string array is[index] = gets string index from string array, if read-write also write string of index is1(..) , is2(...) string array see above is1[x] , is2[x] string array see above sin(x) = calculates the sinus(x) (if defined USE_ANGLE_FUNC) acos(x) = calculates the acos(x) (if defined USE_ANGLE_FUNC) sqrt(x) = calculates the sqrt(x) (if defined USE_ANGLE_FUNC) abs(x) = calculates the absolute value of x mpt(x) = measure pulse time, x>=0 defines pin to use, -1 returns low pulse time,-2 return high pulse time (if defined USE_ANGLE_FUNC) rnd(x) = return a random number between 0 and x, (seed may be set by rnd(-x)) sf(F) = sets the CPU Frequency (ESP32) to 80,160,240 Mhz, returns current Freq. s(x) = explicit conversion from number x to string mqtts = MQTT connection status: 0 = disconnected, >0 = connected wbut = button status of watch side button (if defined USE_TTGO_WATCH) wdclk = double tapped on display (if defined USE_TTGO_WATCH) wtch(sel) = gets state from touch panel sel=0 => touched, sel=1 => x position, sel=2 => y position (if defined USE_TTGO_WATCH) slp(time) = sleep time in seconds, pos values => light sleep, neg values => deep sleep (if defined USE_TTGO_WATCH) play(path) = play mp3 audio from filesystem (if defined USE_TTGO_WATCH) say(\"text\") = plays specified text to speech (if defined USE_TTGO_WATCH) wifis = Wi-Fi connection status: 0 = disconnected, >0 = connected wcs = send this line to webpage (WebContentSend) wm = contains source of web request code e.g. 0 = Sensor display (FUNC_WEB_SENSOR) sml(m 0 bd) = set SML baudrate of Meter m to bd (baud) sml(m 1 htxt) = send SML Hexstring htxt as binary to Meter m (if defined USE_SML_SCRIPT_CMD) sml(m 2) = reads serial data received by Meter m into string (if m<0 reads hex values, else asci values)(if defined USE_SML_SCRIPT_CMD) sml[n] = get value of SML energy register n (if defined USE_SML_SCRIPT_CMD) enrg[n] = get value of energy register n 0=total, 1..3 voltage of phase 1..3, 4..6 current of phase 1..3, 7..9 power of phase 1..3 (if defined USE_ENERGY_SENSOR) gjp(\"host\" \"path\") = trigger HTTPS JSON page read as used by Tesla Powerwall (if defined SCRIPT_GET_HTTPS_JP) tsN(ms) = set up to 4 timers (N=1..4) to millisecond time on expiration triggers section >tiN (if defined USE_SCRIPT_TIMER) hours = hours mins = mins secs = seconds day = day of month wday = day of week (Sunday=1,Monday=2;Tuesday=3;Wednesday=4,Thursday=5,Friday=6,Saturday=7) month = month year = year epoch = epoch time (from 2019-1-1 00:00) eres = result of >E section set this var to 1 in section >E to tell Tasmota event is handled (prevents MQTT) The following variables are cleared after reading true: chg[var] = true if a variables value was changed (numeric vars only) upd[var] = true if a variable was updated boot = true on BOOT tinit = true on time init tset = true on time set mqttc = true on mqtt connect mqttd = true on mqtt disconnect wific = true on wifi connect wifid = true on wifi disconnect System variables (for debugging) stack = stack size heap = free heap size pheap = PSRAM free heap size (ESP32) core = current core (0 or 1) (ESP32) ram = used ram size slen = script length freq = cpu frequency micros = running microseconds millis = running milliseconds loglvl = loglevel of script cmds ( may be set also ) Remarks: If you define a variable with the same name as a special variable that special variable is discarded Commands ~ => <command> Execute recursion disabled +> <command> Execute recursion enabled -> <command> Execute - do not send MQTT or log messages (i.e., silent execute - useful to reduce traffic) Variable Substitution - A single percent sign must be given as %% - Variable replacement within commands is allowed using %varname% . Optionally, the decimal places precision for numeric values may be specified by placing a digit ( %Nvarname% , N = 0..9 ) in front of the substitution variable (e.g., Humidity: %3hum%%% will output Humidity: 43.271% ) - instead of variables arbitrary calculations my be inserted by bracketing %N(formula)% - Linefeed and carriage return may be defined by \\n and \\r Special commands: print or =>print prints to the log for debugging A Tasmota MQTT RESULT message invokes the script's E section. Add print statements to debug a script. Example >E slider=Dimmer power=POWER if upd [ slider ]> 0 then print slider updated % slider % endif if upd [ power ]> 0 then print power updated % power % endif break exits a section or terminates a for next loop dpx sets decimal precision to x (0-9) svars save permanent vars delay(x) pauses x milliseconds (should be as short as possible) beep(f l) (ESP32) beeps with a passive piezo beeper. beep(-f 0) attaches PIN f to the beeper, beep(f l) starts a sound with frequency f (Hz) and len l (ms). f=0 stops the sound. spin(x b) set GPIO x (0..16) to value b (0,1). Only bit 0 of b is used - even values set the GPIO to 0 and uneven values set the GPIO to 1 spinm(x m) set GPIO x (0..16) to mode m (input=0, output=1, input with pullup=2,alternatively b may be: O=out, I=in, P=in with pullup) ws2812(array dstoffset) copies an array (defined with m:vname ) to the WS2812 LED chain. The array length should be defined as long as the number of pixels. Color is coded as 24 bit RGB. optionally the destinationoffset in the LED chain may be given hsvrgb(h s v) converts hue (0..360), saturation (0..100) and value (0..100) to RGB color dt display text command (if #define USE_DISPLAY) #name names a subroutine. Subroutine is called with =#name #name(param) names a subroutine with a parameter. Subroutine is called with =#name(param) Subroutines end with the next # or > line or break. Subroutines may be nested Parameters can be numbers or strings and on type mismatch are converted If #define USE_SCRIPT_SUB_COMMAND is included in your user_config_override.h , a subroutine may be invoked via the Console or MQTT using the subroutine's name. For example, a declared subroutine #SETLED(num) may be invoked by typing SETLED 1 in the Console. The parameter 1 is passed into the num argument. This also works with string parameters. It is possible to \"replace\" internal Tasmota commands. For example, if a #POWER1(num) subroutine is declared, the command POWER1 is processed in the scripter instead of in the main Tasmota code. =(svar) executes a routine whose name is passed as a string in a variable (dynamic or self modifying code). The string has to start with > or =# for the routine to be executed. D svar = \"=#subroutine\" S = ( svar ) #subroutine => print subroutine was executed For loop (loop count must not be less than 1, no direct nesting supported) for var < from > < to > < inc > next Switch selector (numeric or string) switch x case a case b ends Conditional Statements There are two syntax alternatives. You may NOT mix both formats. if a==b and x==y or k==i then = do this else = do that endif or if a==b and x==y or k==i { = do this } else { = do that } Remarks: The last closing bracket must be on a separate line Calculations are permitted in conditional expressions, e.g., if var1 - var2 == var3 * var4 Conditional expressions may be enclosed in parentheses. The statement must be on a single line. e.g., if ((a==b) and ((c==d) or (c==e)) and (s!=\"x\")) mapping function mp(x str1 str2 ... str ) It addresses a standard task with less code and much flexibility: mapping an arbitrary incoming numeric value into the allowed range. The numeric value x passed as the first parameter is compared to the rules in the order they are provided as subsequent sting parameters. If the value matches the criteria, the defined value is returned. Subsequent rules are skipped. If x matches none of the rules, x is returned unchanged. Rules consist of one of the comparison operators < > = followed by a numeric value v1, optionally followed by a colon and another numeric value v2. <|>|= v1 [: v2 ] Example 1 : \"<8:0\" - this rule reads : If x is less than 8 , return 0 . Example 2 : \">100\" - this rule reads : If x is greater than 100 , return 100 . Example 3 : y = mp ( x \"<8:0\" \">100\" ) Assigns 0 to y if x is less than 8 . Assigns 100 to y if x is greater than 100 . Assigns x to y for all values of x that do not meet the above criteria ( 8 to 100 ). The above code of example 3 does the same as the following code - with just one line of code and 15 characters less : y = x if x < 8 { y = 0 } if x > 100 { y = 100 } E-mail #define USE_SENDMAIL Enabling this feature also enables Tasmota TLS as sendmail uses SSL. sendmail [server:port:user:passwd:from:to:subject] msg Example sendmail [smtp.gmail.com:465:user:passwd:sender@gmail.com:<rec@gmail.com:alarm] %string% Remark: A number of e-mail servers (such as Gmail) require the receiver's e-mail address to be enclosed by < ... as in example above. Most other e-mail servers also accept this format. While ESP8266 sendmail needs brackets, ESP32 sendmail inserts brackets itself so you should not specify brackets here. The following parameters can be specified during compilation via #define directives in user_config_override.h : * EMAIL_SERVER * EMAIL_PORT * EMAIL_USER * EMAIL_PASSWORD * EMAIL_FROM To use any of these values, pass an * as its corresponding argument placeholder. sendmail [*:*:*:*:*:<rec@gmail.com:theSubject] theMessage Instead of passing the msg as a string constant, the body of the e-mail message may also be composed using the script m (note lower case) section. The specified text in this script section must end with an # character. sendmail will use the m section if * is passed as the msg parameter. in this >m section you may also specify email attachments. @/filename specifies a file to be attached (if file system is present) &arrayname specifies an array attachment (as tab delimeted text, no file system needed) See [Scripting Cookbook Example].(#send-e-mail) Subscribe, Unsubscribe #define SUPPORT_MQTT_EVENT subscribe and unsubscribe commands are supported. In contrast to rules, no event is generated but the event name specifies a variable defined in D section and this variable is automatically set on transmission of the subscribed item within a script the subscribe cmd must be send with +> instead of => the MQTT decoder may be configured for more space in user config overwrite by #define MQTT_EVENT_MSIZE xxx (default is 256) #define MQTT_EVENT_JSIZE xxx (default is 400) SD Card Support (+ 10k flash) #define USE_SCRIPT_FATFS CARD_CS CARD_CS = GPIO of card chip select SD card uses standard hardware SPI GPIO: mosi,miso,sclk with 4M flash on ESP8266 and special linker file you may specify -1 for CS and get a flash file system with the same functionality but but very low capacity (e.g. 2 MB) A maximum of four files may be open at a time e.g., allows for logging sensors to a tab delimited file and then downloading the file ( see Sensor Logging example ) The downloading of files may be executed in a kind of \"multitasking\" when bit 7 of loglvl is set (128+loglevel) Without multitasking 150kb/s (all processes are stopped during downloading), with multitasking 50kb/s (other Tasmota processes are running) The script itself is also stored on the SD card with a default size of 4096 characters SD card directory support (+ 1,2k flash) #define SDCARD_DIR Shows a web SD card directory (submenu of scripter) where you can upload and download files to/from sd card fr=fo(\"fname\" m) open file fname, mode 0=read, 1=write, 2=append (returns file reference (0-3) or -1 for error) (alternatively m may be: r=read, w=write, a=append) res=fw(\"text\" fr) writes text to (the end of) file fr, returns number of bytes written res=fr(svar fr) reads a string into svar, returns bytes read.

However, for devices like the Moes QS-WiFi-D01 Dimmer , this is achieved by a pulse frequency when connected to the GPIO, and these pulses are captured by Counter1 in Tasmota. When the light is OFF and there is a short period of pulses - then turn the light ON at the previous dimmer level. When the light is ON and there is a short period of pulses - then turn the light OFF . When there is a longer period of pulses (i.e., HOLD ) - toggle dimming direction and then adjust the brightness level as long as the button is pressed or until the limits are reached.

The number of permanent variables is limited by Tasmota rules space (50 bytes) - numeric variables are 4 bytes; string variables are one byte longer than the length of string t:vname specifies countdown timers, if >0 they are decremented in seconds until zero is reached. see example below i:vname specifies auto increment counters if =0 (in seconds) g:vname specifies global variable which is linked to all global variables with the same defintion on all devices in the homenet. when a variable is updated in one device it is instantly updated in all other devices. if a section >G exists it is executed when a variable is updated from another device (this is done via UDP-multicast, so not always reliable) m:vname specifies a median filter variable with 5 entries (for elimination of outliers) M:vname specifies a moving average filter variable with 8 entries (for smoothing data) (max 5 filters in total m+M) optional another filter length (1..127) can be given after the definition. Filter vars can be accessed also in indexed mode vname[x] (x = 1..N , x = 0 returns current array index pointer, x = -1 returns arry lenght) Using this filter, vars can be used as arrays, #define LARGE_ARRAYS allows for arrays up to 1000 entries array may also be permanent by specifying an extra :p m:p:vname defines a permanent array.

The statement must be on a single line. e.g., if ((a==b) and ((c==d) or (c==e)) and (s!=\"x\")) mapping function mp(x str1 str2 ... str ) It addresses a standard task with less code and much flexibility: mapping an arbitrary incoming numeric value into the allowed range. The numeric value x passed as the first parameter is compared to the rules in the order they are provided as subsequent sting parameters. If the value matches the criteria, the defined value is returned. Subsequent rules are skipped. If x matches none of the rules, x is returned unchanged. Rules consist of one of the comparison operators < > = followed by a numeric value v1, optionally followed by a colon and another numeric value v2. <|>|= v1 [: v2 ] Example 1 : \"<8:0\" - this rule reads : If x is less than 8 , return 0 . Example 2 : \">100\" - this rule reads : If x is greater than 100 , return 100 . Example 3 : y = mp ( x \"<8:0\" \">100\" ) Assigns 0 to y if x is less than 8 . Assigns 100 to y if x is greater than 100 . Assigns x to y for all values of x that do not meet the above criteria ( 8 to 100 ). The above code of example 3 does the same as the following code - with just one line of code and 15 characters less : y = x if x < 8 { y = 0 } if x > 100 { y = 100 } E-mail #define USE_SENDMAIL Enabling this feature also enables Tasmota TLS as sendmail uses SSL. sendmail [server:port:user:passwd:from:to:subject] msg Example sendmail [smtp.gmail.com:465:user:passwd:sender@gmail.com:<rec@gmail.com:alarm] %string% Remark: A number of e-mail servers (such as Gmail) require the receiver's e-mail address to be enclosed by < ... as in example above. Most other e-mail servers also accept this format. While ESP8266 sendmail needs brackets, ESP32 sendmail inserts brackets itself so you should not specify brackets here. The following parameters can be specified during compilation via #define directives in user_config_override.h : * EMAIL_SERVER * EMAIL_PORT * EMAIL_USER * EMAIL_PASSWORD * EMAIL_FROM To use any of these values, pass an * as its corresponding argument placeholder. sendmail [*:*:*:*:*:<rec@gmail.com:theSubject] theMessage Instead of passing the msg as a string constant, the body of the e-mail message may also be composed using the script m (note lower case) section. The specified text in this script section must end with an # character. sendmail will use the m section if * is passed as the msg parameter. in this >m section you may also specify email attachments. @/filename specifies a file to be attached (if file system is present) &arrayname specifies an array attachment (as tab delimeted text, no file system needed) See [Scripting Cookbook Example].(#send-e-mail) Subscribe, Unsubscribe #define SUPPORT_MQTT_EVENT subscribe and unsubscribe commands are supported.

This is not only valid for your mobile phones and computers, but also for you Smart TV, you Alexa, or all of your SONOFF devices (ESP8266). There are following potential risks you have to mitigate: Someone hacks your device and is able to log in into your WLAN. (why is this a problem? 1 ) Someone hacks your device and is able to read and change any value on your MQTT server (why is this a problem? 2 ) Someone hacks your network and can interact with your devices (why is this a problem? 3 ) Someone hacks your device and use it for different things like mail bot or DOS (Denial of Service) device or WLAN jammer (why is this a problem? 4 ) Scenario 1 If someone is able to get your WLAN key, he can login into your network, if he is nearby and scan for any traffic and for any devices. Many communication is not encrypted in your WLAN by default. Therefore be part of your WLAN gives the attacker a great opportunity to screw-up the rest of your infrastructure. Also be part of your WLAN does mean, that the attacker can use your IP-Address and your traffic to do nasty things. Scenario 2 If you can hack an ESP82xx device, you might get access to the keys stored in the device. For example, the MQTT password allows you to read ALL of your devices and change any device at any time. With the information of the MQTT-Server user/password, it might be not required anymore to physically be in your WLAN. Maybe your MQTT Server is publicly accessible. Then the attacker can control your home from any place. Update: Beginning with version 6.0.0, passwords are not directly exposed through the serial connection or web interface in configuration mode. Therefore it is now less simple, however still possible to obtain the MQTT or WLAN password from a device. Such can be accomplished by downloading a configuration backup via the web UI of the device and decoding it using the decode-config.py script found in the Tasmota tools folder. Scenario 3 It might happen, that e.g. your Samsung SmartTV is not as secure as it should be and an attacker gets access to your network. Now he can listen to any traffic and maybe can make changes on all of your IoT devices. Scenario 4 If someone uses your device to spam mail or do a DOS attack the impact at your home is minimal. You might have more outbound traffic, but maybe you don't recognize this either. But thousands of hacked IoT devices can generate tremendous trouble even at the largest internet providers. I hope these four typical scenarios ( the list is not complete) give you some idea, why you should take care, even if you're not a terrorist and normally nobody is interested into hacking you personally. Securing your WLAN ~ That you should have a WLAN key and use WPA2 for encryption is a \"no brainer\". This is a minimum requirement. Now think about someone can extract the password from the device. E.g. because the device is in the garden and someone with a Laptop and some USB stuff can connect and extract information. The hacker will get the key. The ONLY possible preventive action to mitigate worst case scenario is to have a second WLAN, like the \"FritzBox Guest WLAN\". Many other routers offer similar things. This guest WLAN has no access to your private WLAN. Additionally, there are some interesting switched you can configure for the WLAN. At the FritzRouter you can configure \"network separation\" . At Fritz this is done by DISABLE \"The wireless devices connected with the guest access can communicate with each other\" . This does mean, that a device in the network can not interact with any other device in the WLAN. It can only communicate with the Internet. This simple configuration prevents any attacker to do nasty stuff on YOUR network. Now we have to take care, that the attacker is not creating a Bot-Net and sending e.g., Spam-Mails. Normally a device in the \"guest WLAN\" can use any internet service. For our IoT devices and for any new device we can create a Router rule, that ONLY MQTT is allowed to our server and any other traffic is blocked. This is a great configuration because it limits the options what a hacker can do. If you have a FritzBox following configuration has to be created to get this working: Create Profile to block all communication except MQTT and NTP Time services. Internet -> Filters -> List -> \"Add Network Application\" \"New Protocol\" (Add four rules, This will block all but UDP123 for Timeserver and 8883 for MQTT Server) TCP from any to Port 1 to 8882 TCP from any to Port 8884 to 65636 UDP from any to Port 1 to 122 UDP from any to Port 124 to 65636 Create a list of \"websites\" your IoT devices are allowed to access. Internet -> Filters -> List -> \"Permitted web sites\" -> EDIT yourserver 01.de.pool.ntp.org Replace with the full qualified name of your router in the Internet. NTP server - Use the one you have defined in Tasmota to be the timeserver. Create a profile you can attach to your IoT devices. Internet -> Filters -> Access profiles -> \"new Access profile\" \"Filter Web sites\" DISABLE \"Allow HTTPS queries\" SELECT \"Permit web sites (whitelist) Now you will probably ask two questions: How can I communicate with my MQTT Server in my personal WLAN if only traffic into the internet is allowed? How can I access the WebConsole of my devices to upload new Firmware and/or make investigations? The first topic will be solved by exposing your MQTT server to the Internet (no worries, can be done securely). The second topic has only a workaround. If you want access to your devices you need to change the configuration temporary on your router and ENABLE \"The wireless devices connected with the guest access can communicate with each other\" . Secondly, you must login with your Laptop into the GuestWLAN to be able to communicate. If the Webserver is running you should be able to connect and upload e.g. a new firmware. Securing your Communication ~ In the world of IoT devices and more and more devices in a network, it is essential to use encryption ALL the time. The Tasmota project is able to enable encryption for MQTT. This is great. But it cannot enable encryption on the WebServer. This is bad. As a conclusion, the Webserver must be switched OFF all the time and only be switched ON for administrative purpose. This also disables the feature to change the Relay Status with an HTTP REST call. But this option is insecure anyway and should be avoided. Now let's work on the MQTT configuration. Also here an attacker can get access to user and password. To minimize the impact EVERY and really EVERY device must have a unique USER and a unique password. If you don't follow this rule the attacker get one device he can control ALL devices. With the USER/PASSWORD he now can control the one device he already holds in his hands. ok, no big deal. How to configure Mosquitto? In general, Tasmota stores data in stat/ /+ and tele/ /+. or cmnd/ /+ to control something. If we use the as username we can make some quite nice and straight forward configuration. Example: Topic: ESP_123456 User: ESP_123456 (must be the same to Topic) password: 987654321 Configuration file: /etc/mosquitte/conf.d/jp.acl user root topic read # topic write # pattern read cmnd /% u /# pattern write stat /% u /# pattern write tele /% u /# My user root is allowed to do everything. This is used in my home-automation to control all devices and listen to all devices. The \"pattern\" is used for ALL other users and the %u is a substitute. The great thing is that the device can read its configuration but cannot write to it. And the status information it posts to the /status/ but is not able to read it afterward. With this minimal configuration, Tasmota devices are running. To add the different user to Mosquitte the following two commands work fine. There is also a re-read available, but a restart works better for me. sudo mosquitto_passwd -b /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/jp.pw ESP_123456 987654321 sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto restart If this is running, we switch the Mosquitto to secure communication on Port 8883 and disable all insecure options. /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/user.conf # User Config password_file / etc / mosquitto / conf . d / jp . pw acl_file / etc / mosquitto / conf . d / jp . acl allow_anonymous false listener 8883 cafile / etc / mosquitto / certs / ca . crt certfile / etc / mosquitto / certs / server . crt keyfile / etc / mosquitto / certs / server . key require_certificate false How to generate the certificates in mosquitto please look at: Mosquitto SSL Configuration - MQTT TLS Security Adding TLS to connect to Mosquitto Internet of Things messaging MQTT with TLS Enable Secure Communication with TLS and the Mosquitto Broker SSL/TLS on Tasmota ~ TLS article explains how to set it up in Tasmota Disable unsecured fallback WiFi (WifiManager) ~ In case your Wifi SSID is not available (i.e. access point dies), the WiFiManager will jump into action and make your tasmota devices available using an unsecured access point.

Example: Topic: ESP_123456 User: ESP_123456 (must be the same to Topic) password: 987654321 Configuration file: /etc/mosquitte/conf.d/jp.acl user root topic read # topic write # pattern read cmnd /% u /# pattern write stat /% u /# pattern write tele /% u /# My user root is allowed to do everything. This is used in my home-automation to control all devices and listen to all devices. The \"pattern\" is used for ALL other users and the %u is a substitute. The great thing is that the device can read its configuration but cannot write to it. And the status information it posts to the /status/ but is not able to read it afterward. With this minimal configuration, Tasmota devices are running. To add the different user to Mosquitte the following two commands work fine. There is also a re-read available, but a restart works better for me. sudo mosquitto_passwd -b /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/jp.pw ESP_123456 987654321 sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto restart If this is running, we switch the Mosquitto to secure communication on Port 8883 and disable all insecure options. /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/user.conf # User Config password_file / etc / mosquitto / conf . d / jp . pw acl_file / etc / mosquitto / conf . d / jp . acl allow_anonymous false listener 8883 cafile / etc / mosquitto / certs / ca . crt certfile / etc / mosquitto / certs / server . crt keyfile / etc / mosquitto / certs / server . key require_certificate false How to generate the certificates in mosquitto please look at: Mosquitto SSL Configuration - MQTT TLS Security Adding TLS to connect to Mosquitto Internet of Things messaging MQTT with TLS Enable Secure Communication with TLS and the Mosquitto Broker","title":"Securing your Communication"},{"location":"Securing-your-IoT-from-hacking/#ssltls-on-tasmota","text":"TLS article explains how to set it up in Tasmota","title":"SSL/TLS on Tasmota"},{"location":"Securing-your-IoT-from-hacking/#disable-unsecured-fallback-wifi-wifimanager","text":"In case your Wifi SSID is not available (i.e. access point dies), the WiFiManager will jump into action and make your tasmota devices available using an unsecured access point.

Important things to consider ~ There are several I 2 C sensor examples you can take from the development codebase when writing your own and you are encouraged to do this as it is a quick and easy way to see how things fit together. The Tasmota firmware is essentially intended for ESP8266/ESP8285 Wi-Fi SoC based devices and commits to the main development branch will be subject to review based on whether or not what you intend to develop or add to the existing code is relevant to the general ESP device users. That being said, there is a lot of development going into the firmware which extends the functionality of standard off the shelf Sonoff devices. The firmware in itself is also useful for boards such as the WeMos ESP82xx boards. More technically inclined individuals who use generic ESP82xx modules in their own circuits to provide more access to pins and the ability to add more sensors and hardware external to the device or the generic ESP82xx module circuits can also take advantage of Tasmota. The resources on the ESP82xx are finite. Most devices ship with 1MByte SPI flash which means for the generic device users, the code generally needs to be less than 502KBytes to ensure that OTA (Over The Air) flash functionality (which is the main reason why people use this firmware) remains available. RAM is also limited to an absolute maximum of 80KBytes. This memory is divided into heap (used by global variables and Strings) and stack (used by local variables) where stack space is just 4KBytes. Given the above resource constraints its important to keep your code as small as possible, as fast running as possible, and use as little RAM as possible. You need to think about these resource constraints all the time whilst doing any development you wish to add to the firmware functionality - Face the fact that microcontroller development isn't as close a relative to standard computer programming as you'd expect. You will be adding code to an existing framework which requires you to adhere to some simple but strict rules such as not having any infinite loops like you would have in your generic Arduino code and try to avoid using the delay() functions when writing your code as this will cause the entire firmware to be subjected to the delays you have added - Infinite loops will cause the firmware to lock up completely! If your sensor has configuration options please make these available by using the SensorXX framework which is already incorporated in the base code - This may not stop you from using a web-based configuration interface but since web-based configuration takes up a lot of code space in flash it is very important to make this optional by means of a compiler directive or a #define in the configuration file and as such something you need to keep in mind during your development and debugging - The more progressively optional additional features are in your driver the smaller the basic codebase can be for minimalist implementations. Whilst developing drivers for devices that use the I 2 C bus always consider other devices already supported in the codebase which may use the same address range. This could mean you need to find a unique way of differentiating your device detection from other devices on the same address range (e.g. querying a model-specific register) and/or disabling by #undef existing devices if yours is selected with a #define statement and in such cases always provide a warning to the user during compile time using the #warning pragma such as including #warning **** Turned off conflicting drivers SHT and VEML6070 **** in your code. DO NOT ADD WEB INTERFACE FOR SENSOR CONFIGURATION if your sensor requires additional user configuration. The reason for this is the additional program memory required but most importantly the amount of RAM required to even create minimal user interfaces. Running out of RAM during runtime will lead to abnormal behaviour of your driver and/or other drivers or the entire firmware! See sensors such as the MCP23008/MCP23017 driver on more information on how to implement SensorXX commands instead! While developing you might want to enable additional debugging provided by file xdrv_99_debug.ino using #define USE_DEBUG_DRIVER which provides some commands for managing configuration settings and CPU timing. In addition you can enable define PROFILE_XSNS_SENSOR_EVERY_SECOND to profile your drivers duration. Do not assume others will know immediately how to use your addition and know that you will need to write a Wiki for it in the end. Managing a Forked Branch ~ If you plan to submit a PR bigger than a simple change in one file, here is a short intro about how to do a clean PR. fork the Tasmota repository in Github git clone https://github.com/<github_user>/Tasmota.git and work on your local copy git remote add upstream https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota.git git checkout development git checkout -b <temp_branch> to create a working branch where you can push commits git push --set-upstream origin <temp_branch> work on your local version and push as many commits as you want When you think it is ready to merge and submit a PR: git checkout development to go back to the main branch git pull upstream development to update all the latest changes git push to update your fork git checkout -b <pr_branch> to create a new branch for the final PR git push --set-upstream origin <pr_branch> Merge the edits but be sure to remove the history of your local commits git merge --squash <temp_branch> git commit -m \"Message\" Now you have a clean single commit from which you can create the PR on the Tasmota Github. Directory/file structure ~ Sensor libraries are located in the lib/ directory. Sensor drivers are located in the tasmota/ directory. The filename of the sensor driver is xsns_<driver_ID>_<driver_name>.ino , e.g. xsns_05_ds18b20.ino where <driver_ID> is a unique number between 01 and 90 and <driver_name> is a human-readable name of the driver. Using generic libraries from external sources for sensors should be avoided as far as possible as they usually include code for other platforms and are not always written in an optimized way. API structure ~ Pre-processor directives ~ Conditional compiling of a sensor driver is achieved by adding a pre-processor directive of the scheme USE_<driver_name> in my_user_config.h . Accordingly the driver code has to be wrapped in #ifdef USE_<driver_name> ... #endif // USE_<driver_name> . Any Sensor driver must contain a pre-processor directive defining the driver ID by the scheme #define XSNS_<driver_ID> . Callback function ~ Any sensor driver needs a callback function following the scheme // Conditional compilation of driver #ifdef USE_<driver_name> // Define driver ID #define XSNS_<driver_ID> <driver_ID> /** * The callback function Xsns<driver_ID>() interfaces Tasmota with the sensor driver. * * It provides the Tasmota callback IDs. * * @param byte callback_id Tasmota function ID. * @return boolean Return value. * @pre None. * @post None. * */ boolean Xsns < driverID > ( byte callback_id ) { // Set return value to `false` boolean result = false ; // Check if I2C interface mode // if(i2c_flg) { // Check which callback ID is called by Tasmota switch ( callback_id ) { case FUNC_INIT : break ; case FUNC_EVERY_50_MSECOND : break ; case FUNC_EVERY_SECOND : break ; case FUNC_JSON_APPEND : break ; #ifdef USE_WEBSERVER case FUNC_WEB_APPEND : break ; #endif // USE_WEBSERVER case FUNC_SAVE_BEFORE_RESTART : break ; case FUNC_COMMAND : break ; } // } // if(i2c_flg) // Return boolean result return result ; } #endif // USE_<driver_name> Callback IDs ~ FUNC_INIT This callback ID is called when sensor drivers should be initialized. FUNC_EVERY_50_MSECOND This callback ID is called every 50 milliseconds, e.g. for near real-time operation FUNC_EVERY_SECOND This callback ID is called every second. It can be useful for anything that you need to do on a per second basis and is commonly used as an entry point to detect a driver or initialize an externally driven device such as a sensor, relay board or other forms of input/output required by your driver. You would normally want to make sure you've detected and initialised before it is used by JSON_APPEND , etc. so that its ready to serve data. The generally accepted way to use this would be to detect your sensor and once this is done set a sensor value accordingly so that the function does not use unnecessary resources during future calls, for example: void MySensorDetect () { if ( MySensorDetected ) { return ; } /* * Perform the code which needs to be completed to * detect your sensor and then set MySensorDetected to * a non-zero value which will prevent this section * of your code to re-run every time the function is * called. * * Under normal circumstances you'd not need to do * re-detect or initialise your sensor once it has been * done */ } Setting a flag that the driver was successful in detecting the attached chip/board via I 2 C or SPI will prevent it from continuously trying to initialize an already initialized device. When writing your function responsible for detecting an externally connected I 2 C device try to create a method by which you read or write to specific registers that would be applicable to that specific I 2 C device only as to confirm a positive detect for the device. If this is not done extensively it will lead to some drivers getting false detects for a different device type simply because it shares the same I 2 C address. Unless your driver is specifically going to use the entire array of addresses provisioned by the manufacturer please consider using a #define USE_MYCHIPNAME_ADDR in the my_user_config.h so that the user may specify the address on which to expect the device. This is of course only applicable to drivers that are not enabled by default in any of the pre-built binaries. I 2 C address auto-detection example #define MPR121_I2C_ADDR_1ST 0x5A /** 1st I2C address of sensor model **/ #define MPR121_I2C_ADDR_NUM 4 /** Number of sensors/I2C addresses **/ #define MPR121_I2C_ID_REG 0x5D /** Sensor model specific ID register **/ #define MPR121_I2C_ID_VAL 0x24 /** Sensor model specific ID register value **/ /* Sensor data struct type declaration/default definition */ typedef struct { bool connected = false ; /** Status if sensor is connected at I2C address */ bool running = false ; /** Running state of sensor */ . . . } mpr121 ; // Declare array of sensor data structs mpr121 mpr121 [ MPR121_I2C_ADDR_NUM ]; // Sensor specific init function void mpr121_init () { // Loop through I2C addresses for ( uint8_t i = 0 ; i < MPR121_I2C_ADDR_NUM ); i ++ ) { // Check if sensor is connected on I2C address mpr121 [ i ]. connected = ( MPR121_I2C_ID_VAL == I2cRead8 ( MPR121_I2C_ADDR_1ST + i , MPR121_I2C_ID_REG ); if ( mpr121 [ i ]. connected ) { // Log sensor found snprintf_P ( log_data , sizeof ( log_data ), PSTR ( D_LOG_I2C \"MPR121-%d \" D_FOUND_AT \" 0x%X\" ), i , MPR121_I2C_ADDR_1ST + i ); AddLog ( LOG_LEVEL_INFO ); // Initialize sensor . . . // Set running to true mpr121 [ i ]. running = true ; } } if ( ! ( mpr121 [ 0 ]. connected || mpr121 [ 1 ]. connected || mpr121 [ 2 ]. connected || mpr121 [ 3 ]. connected )){ snprintf_P ( log_data , sizeof ( log_data ), PSTR ( D_LOG_I2C \"MPR121: No sensors found\" )); AddLog ( LOG_LEVEL_INFO ); } } Four advanced methods to use FUNC_EVERY_SECOND (Food for thought) : * If a sensor needs an action which takes a long time, like more than 100mS, the action will be started here for a future follow-up. Using the uptime variable for testing like (uptime &1) will happen every 2 seconds. An example is the DS18B20 driver where readings (conversions they call it) can take up to 800mS from the initial request. * If a sensor needed the previous action it is now time to gather the information and store it in a safe place to be used by FUNC_JSON_APPEND and/or FUNC_WEB_APPEND . Using the else function of the previous test (uptime &1) will happen every 2 seconds too but just 1 second later than the previous action. * If a sensor does not respond for 10 times the sensor detection flag could be reset which will stop further processing until the sensor is re-detected. This is currently not being used actively as some users complain about disappearing sensors for whatever reason - Could be hardware related but easier to make Tasmota a little more flexible. * Making re-detection of a sensor possible by executing this once every 100 seconds (94 == (uptime %100)) a re-attached sensor can be detected without a restart of Tasmota. The 94 given in this example should be different for every sensor driver to make sure not all sensors start detection at the same time. Using the drivers index number should be a good starting point. FUNC_PREP_BEFORE_TELEPERIOD NOTE: This callback ID is deprecated as sensors should prepare for more regular updates due to \"realtime\" rule execution. Use FUNC_EVERY_SECOND instead. See examples used in xsns_05_ds18x20.ino and xsns_09_bmp.ino where updated sensor data is stored in preparation to calls to FUNC_JSON_APPEND and FUNC_WEB_APPEND. FUNC_JSON_APPEND This callback ID is called when TelePeriod is due to append telemetry data to the MQTT JSON string or at approximately every 2 seconds when a rule is checked, e.g. snprintf_P ( mqtt_data , sizeof ( mqtt_data ), PSTR ( \"{ \\\" MPR121%c \\\" :{ \\\" Button%i \\\" :%i}}\" ), pS -> id [ i ], j , BITC ( i , j )); FUNC_WEB_APPEND This callback ID is called every millisecond when HTML code should be added to the Tasmota web-interface main page, e.g., snprintf_P ( mqtt_data , sizeof ( mqtt_data ), PSTR ( \"%s{s}MPR121%c Button%d{m}%d{e}\" ), mqtt_data , pS -> id [ i ], j , BITC ( i , j )); It should be wrapped in #ifdef USE_WEBSERVER ... #endif // USE_WEBSERVER FUNC_SAVE_BEFORE_RESTART This callback ID is called to allow a sensor to prepare for saving configuration changes. To be used to save volatile data just before a restart. Variables can be appended to struct SYSCFG {} Settings in file tasmota/settings.h . FUNC_COMMAND This callback ID is called when a sensor specific command Sensor<xx> or Driver<xx> is executed where xx is the sensor index. case FUNC_COMMAND : if ( XSNS_ < driver_ID > == XdrvMailbox . index ) { result = < driver_name > Command () { ... }; // Return true on success } break ; // Data struct of FUNC_COMMAND ID struct XDRVMAILBOX { uint16_t valid ; // ??? uint16_t index ; // Sensor index uint16_t data_len ; // Length of command string uint16_t payload16 ; // 16 bit unsigned int of payload if it could be converted, otherwise 0 int16_t payload ; // 16 bit signed int of payload if it could be converted, otherwise 0 uint8_t grpflg ; // ??? uint8_t notused ; // ??? char * topic ; // Command topic char * data ; // Command string/value - length of which is defined by data_len } XdrvMailbox ; If your driver needs to accept multiple parameters for SensorXX and/or DriverXX please consider using comma delimited formatting and use the already written subStr() function declared in support.ino to parse through the parameters you need. An example of those could be SensorXX reset // The reset parameter may be intercepted using: if ( ! strcmp ( subStr ( sub_string , XdrvMailbox . data , \",\" , 1 ), \"RESET\" )) { // Note 1 used for param number MyDriverName_Reset (); return serviced ; } Or in the case of multiple parameters SensorXX mode , 1 if ( ! strcmp ( subStr ( sub_string , XdrvMailbox . data , \",\" , 1 ), \"MODE\" )) { // Note 1 used for param number uint8_t mode = atoi ( subStr ( sub_string , XdrvMailbox . data , \",\" , 2 ); // Note 2 used for param number } Useful functions ~ MQTT ~ void MqttPublishPrefixTopic_P ( uint8_t prefix , const char * subtopic , boolean retained ) This function publishes MQTT messages immediately, e.g., snprintf_P ( mqtt_data , sizeof ( mqtt_data ), PSTR ( \"{ \\\" MPR121%c \\\" :{ \\\" Button%i \\\" :%i}}\" ), pS -> id [ i ], j , BITC ( i , j )); MqttPublishPrefixTopic_P ( RESULT_OR_STAT , mqtt_data ); Logging ~ void AddLog ( byte loglevel ) This function adds log messages stored in log_data to the local logging system, e.g. snprintf_P ( log_data , sizeof ( log_data ), PSTR ( D_LOG_I2C \"MPR121(%c) \" D_FOUND_AT \" 0x%X\" ), pS -> id [ i ], pS -> i2c_addr [ i ]); AddLog ( LOG_LEVEL_INFO ); void AddLogSerial ( byte loglevel ) This function adds a log message to the local logging system dumping the serial buffer as hex information, e.g. AddLogSerial ( LOG_LEVEL_INFO ); void AddLogMissed ( char * sensor , uint8_t misses ) This function adds a log message to the local logging system about missed sensor reads.

Useful pre-processor directives ~ PSTR(\"string\") This pre-processor directive saves RAM by storing strings in flash instead of RAM. const char MyTextStaticVariable [] PROGMEM = \"string\" ; This pre-processor directive saves RAM by storing strings in flash instead of RAM. You may then reference them directly (if the type matches the parameter required) or force it to 4 byte alignment by using the variable as FPSTR(MyTextStaticVariable) Keeping ESP8266 code compact ~ Below are various tips and tricks to keep ESP8266 code compact and save both Flash and Memory. Flash code is limited to 1024k but keep in mind that to allow OTA upgrade, you need Flash memory to contain two firmwares at the same time. To go beyond 512k, you typically use tasmota-minimal as an intermediate firmware. tasmota-minimal takes roughly 360k, so it's safe not to go uint32_t beyond 620k of Flash. Memory is even more limited: 80k. With Arduino Core and basic Tasmota, there are 25k-30k left of heap space. Heap memory is very precious, running out of memory will generally cause a crash. About ESP8266 ~ ESP8266 is based on Xtensa instruction set . Xtensa is a 32 bits RISC processor core, containing 16 x 32 bits registers. ESP8266 supports integer operations, including 32x32 multiplication. It does not contain an FPU for floating point operations, nor integer divisions. Contrary to classical RISC processors, all instructions are 24 bits wide instead of 32 bits. To increase code compactness, some instructions have a 16 bits version used whenever possible by gcc. If you want to see what assembly is generated by gcc, in file platform.ini , at the section used to compile (ex: [core_2_6_1] ) in section build_flags add: -save-temps=obj -fverbose-asm Gcc will store <file>.s in the same folder as the .o file, typically in .pioenvs/ . First example ~ Let's take a basic function: uint32_t Example ( uint32_t a , uint32_t b ) { return a + b ; } Below is the generated assembly. Function names are mangled using standard C++, i.e. their name derive from their arguments and return types: _Z7Examplejj: add.n a2 , a2 , a3 #, a, b ret.n As you can see, this is the simplest function we can think of. Register A2 holds the first argument and is used for return value. A3 holds the second argument. uint8_t or uint32_t ? ~ uint32_t Example ( uint32_t a , uint32_t b ) { uint8_t c = a + b ; return c ; } Assembly: _Z7Examplejj: add.n a2 , a2 , a3 # tmp52, a, b extui a2 , a2 , 0 , 8 #, tmp52 ret.n Whenever gcc needs to convert from uin32_t to uint8_t , it uses an extra instruction extui <reg>, <reg>, 0, 8 . Whenever you allocate uint8_t as a local variable, it will anyways allocate 32 bits on the stack. In conclusion you can easily use uint32_t in many places in the code. The main reason to force uint8_t are: in structures, to save memory. This is the only place where uint8_t will take 1 byte and the compiler will try to pack as much as 4 uint8_t in 32 bits when you want to ensure that the value can never exceed 255. Beware though that the compiler will just chunk the last 8 bits of a 32 bits value and will not report any overflow. Loops ~ Should you use uint8_t or uint32_t for loops? Let's try: uint32_t Example ( uint32_t a , uint32_t b ) { for ( uint8_t i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++ ) { a += b ; } for ( uint32_t j = 0 ; j < 10 ; j ++ ) { a += b ; } return a ; } Assembly: _Z7Examplejj: movi.n a3 , 0 # ivtmp$7334, <- loop 1 .L2031: add.n a2 , a2 , a3 # a, a, ivtmp$7334 addi.n a3 , a3 , 1 # ivtmp$7334, ivtmp$7334, bnei a3 , 10 , .L2031 # ivtmp$7334,, movi.n a3 , 0 # j, <- loop 2 .L2033: add.n a2 , a2 , a3 # a, a, j addi.n a3 , a3 , 1 # j, j, bnei a3 , 10 , .L2033 # j,, ret.n As you can see here, both loops generate the same assembly for fixed size loops. Let's now see for variable size loops. uint32_t Example ( uint32_t a , uint32_t b ) { for ( uint8_t i = 0 ; i < b ; i ++ ) { a += i ; } for ( uint32_t j = 0 ; j < b ; j ++ ) { a += j ; } return a ; } Assembly: _Z7Examplejj: movi.n a4 , 0 # i, <- loop 1 j .L2030 # .L2031: add.n a2 , a2 , a4 # a, a, i addi.n a4 , a4 , 1 # tmp48, i, extui a4 , a4 , 0 , 8 # i, tmp48 <- extra 32 to 8 bits conversion .L2030: bltu a4 , a3 , .L2031 # i, b, movi.n a4 , 0 # j, <- loop 2 j .L2032 # .L2033: add.n a2 , a2 , a4 # a, a, j addi.n a4 , a4 , 1 # j, j, .L2032: bne a4 , a3 , .L2033 # j, b, ret.n In the first loop, the register a4 needs to be converted from 32 bits to 8 bits in each iteration. Again, there is no definitive rule, but keep in mind that using uint8_t can sometimes increase code size compared to uint32_t . Floats, not doubles! ~ ESP8266 does not have a FPU (Floating Point Unit), all floating point operations are emulated in software and provided in libm.a . The linker removes any unused functions, so we need to limit the number of floating point function calls. Rule 1 : use ints where you can, avoid floating point operations. Rule 2 : if you really need floating point, always use float , never ever use double . Let's now see why. float fits in 32 bits, with a mantissa of 20 bits, exponent of TODO. The mantissa is 20 bits wide, which provides enough precision for most of our needs. float is 32 bits wide and fits in a single register, whereas double is 64 bits and requires 2 registers. float Examplef ( float a , float b ) { return sinf ( a ) * ( b + 0.4f ) - 3.5f ; } Assembly: .literal .LC1012 , 0x3ecccccd < - 0 .4f .literal .LC1013 , 0x40600000 < - 3 .5f _Z8Examplefff: addi sp , sp , -16 #,, <- reserve 16 bytes on stack s32i.n a0 , sp , 12 #, <- save a0 (return address) on stack s32i.n a12 , sp , 8 #, <- save a12 on stack, to free for local var s32i.n a13 , sp , 4 #, <- save a13 on stack, to free for local var mov.n a13 , a3 # b, b <- a3 holds 'b', save to a13 call0 sinf # <- calc sin of a2 (a) l32r a3 , .LC1012 #, <- load 0.4f in a3 mov.n a12 , a2 # D.171139, <- save result 'sin(a)' to a12 mov.n a2 , a13 #, b <- move a13 (second arg: b) to a2 call0 __addsf3 # <- add floats a2 and a3, result to a2 mov.n a3 , a2 # D.171139, <- copy result to a3 mov.n a2 , a12 #, D.171139 <- load a2 with a12: sin(a) call0 __mulsf3 # <- multiply 'sin(a)*(b+0.4f)' l32r a3 , .LC1013 #, <- load a3 with 3.5f call0 __subsf3 # <- substract l32i.n a0 , sp , 12 #, <- restore a0 (return address) l32i.n a12 , sp , 8 #, <- restore a12 l32i.n a13 , sp , 4 #, <- restore a13 addi sp , sp , 16 #,, <- free stack ret.n < - return Now with double : double Exampled ( double a , double b ) { return sin ( a ) * ( b + 0.4 ) - 3.5 ; } Assembly: .literal .LC1014 , 0x9999999a , 0x3fd99999 < - 0 .4 .literal .LC1015 , 0x00000000 , 0x400c0000 < - 3 .5 _Z8Exampleddd: addi sp , sp , -32 #,, s32i.n a0 , sp , 28 #, s32i.n a12 , sp , 24 #, s32i.n a13 , sp , 20 #, s32i.n a14 , sp , 16 #, s32i.n a15 , sp , 12 #, mov.n a14 , a4 #, mov.n a15 , a5 #, call0 sin # l32r a4 , .LC1014 #, l32r a5 , .LC1014 + 4 #, mov.n a12 , a2 #, mov.n a13 , a3 #, mov.n a2 , a14 #, mov.n a3 , a15 #, call0 __adddf3 # mov.n a4 , a2 #, mov.n a5 , a3 #, mov.n a2 , a12 #, mov.n a3 , a13 #, call0 __muldf3 # l32r a4 , .LC1015 #, l32r a5 , .LC1015 + 4 #, call0 __subdf3 # l32i.n a0 , sp , 28 #, l32i.n a12 , sp , 24 #, l32i.n a13 , sp , 20 #, l32i.n a14 , sp , 16 #, l32i.n a15 , sp , 12 #, addi sp , sp , 32 #,, ret.n As you can see the double needs to move many more registers around. Examplef (float) is 84 bytes, Exampled (double) is 119 bytes (+42% code size). Actually it's even worse, sin is larger than float version sinf . Also, never forget to explicitly tag literals as float: always put 1.5f and not 1.5 . Let's see the impact: float Examplef2 ( float a , float b ) { return sinf ( a ) * ( b + 0.4 ) - 3.5 ; // same as above with double literals } Assembly: .literal .LC1014 , 0x9999999a , 0x3fd99999 .literal .LC1015 , 0x00000000 , 0x400c0000 .align 4 .global _Z9Examplef2ff .type _Z9Examplef2ff , @function _Z9Examplef2ff: addi sp , sp , -16 #,, s32i.n a0 , sp , 12 #, s32i.n a12 , sp , 8 #, s32i.n a13 , sp , 4 #, s32i.n a14 , sp , 0 #, mov.n a14 , a3 # b, b call0 sinf # call0 __extendsfdf2 # <- extend float to double mov.n a12 , a2 #, mov.n a2 , a14 #, b mov.n a13 , a3 #, call0 __extendsfdf2 # <- extend float to double l32r a4 , .LC1014 #, l32r a5 , .LC1014 + 4 #, call0 __adddf3 # <- add double mov.n a4 , a2 #, mov.n a5 , a3 #, mov.n a2 , a12 #, mov.n a3 , a13 #, call0 __muldf3 # <- multiply double l32r a4 , .LC1015 #, l32r a5 , .LC1015 + 4 #, call0 __subdf3 # <- substract double call0 __truncdfsf2 # <- truncate double to float l32i.n a0 , sp , 12 #, l32i.n a12 , sp , 8 #, l32i.n a13 , sp , 4 #, l32i.n a14 , sp , 0 #, addi sp , sp , 16 #,, ret.n The last example takes 143 bytes, which is even worse than the double version, because of conversions from float to double and back. Internally, if you don't force float literals, gcc will make all intermediate compute in double and convert to float in the end. This is usually what is wanted: compute with maximum precision and truncate at the last moment. But for ESP8266 we want the opposite: most compact code.

The Tasmota firmware is essentially intended for ESP8266/ESP8285 Wi-Fi SoC based devices and commits to the main development branch will be subject to review based on whether or not what you intend to develop or add to the existing code is relevant to the general ESP device users. That being said, there is a lot of development going into the firmware which extends the functionality of standard off the shelf Sonoff devices. The firmware in itself is also useful for boards such as the WeMos ESP82xx boards. More technically inclined individuals who use generic ESP82xx modules in their own circuits to provide more access to pins and the ability to add more sensors and hardware external to the device or the generic ESP82xx module circuits can also take advantage of Tasmota. The resources on the ESP82xx are finite. Most devices ship with 1MByte SPI flash which means for the generic device users, the code generally needs to be less than 502KBytes to ensure that OTA (Over The Air) flash functionality (which is the main reason why people use this firmware) remains available. RAM is also limited to an absolute maximum of 80KBytes. This memory is divided into heap (used by global variables and Strings) and stack (used by local variables) where stack space is just 4KBytes. Given the above resource constraints its important to keep your code as small as possible, as fast running as possible, and use as little RAM as possible. You need to think about these resource constraints all the time whilst doing any development you wish to add to the firmware functionality - Face the fact that microcontroller development isn't as close a relative to standard computer programming as you'd expect. You will be adding code to an existing framework which requires you to adhere to some simple but strict rules such as not having any infinite loops like you would have in your generic Arduino code and try to avoid using the delay() functions when writing your code as this will cause the entire firmware to be subjected to the delays you have added - Infinite loops will cause the firmware to lock up completely! If your sensor has configuration options please make these available by using the SensorXX framework which is already incorporated in the base code - This may not stop you from using a web-based configuration interface but since web-based configuration takes up a lot of code space in flash it is very important to make this optional by means of a compiler directive or a #define in the configuration file and as such something you need to keep in mind during your development and debugging - The more progressively optional additional features are in your driver the smaller the basic codebase can be for minimalist implementations. Whilst developing drivers for devices that use the I 2 C bus always consider other devices already supported in the codebase which may use the same address range. This could mean you need to find a unique way of differentiating your device detection from other devices on the same address range (e.g. querying a model-specific register) and/or disabling by #undef existing devices if yours is selected with a #define statement and in such cases always provide a warning to the user during compile time using the #warning pragma such as including #warning **** Turned off conflicting drivers SHT and VEML6070 **** in your code. DO NOT ADD WEB INTERFACE FOR SENSOR CONFIGURATION if your sensor requires additional user configuration. The reason for this is the additional program memory required but most importantly the amount of RAM required to even create minimal user interfaces. Running out of RAM during runtime will lead to abnormal behaviour of your driver and/or other drivers or the entire firmware! See sensors such as the MCP23008/MCP23017 driver on more information on how to implement SensorXX commands instead! While developing you might want to enable additional debugging provided by file xdrv_99_debug.ino using #define USE_DEBUG_DRIVER which provides some commands for managing configuration settings and CPU timing. In addition you can enable define PROFILE_XSNS_SENSOR_EVERY_SECOND to profile your drivers duration. Do not assume others will know immediately how to use your addition and know that you will need to write a Wiki for it in the end.","title":"Important things to consider"},{"location":"Sensor-API/#managing-a-forked-branch","text":"If you plan to submit a PR bigger than a simple change in one file, here is a short intro about how to do a clean PR. fork the Tasmota repository in Github git clone https://github.com/<github_user>/Tasmota.git and work on your local copy git remote add upstream https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota.git git checkout development git checkout -b <temp_branch> to create a working branch where you can push commits git push --set-upstream origin <temp_branch> work on your local version and push as many commits as you want When you think it is ready to merge and submit a PR: git checkout development to go back to the main branch git pull upstream development to update all the latest changes git push to update your fork git checkout -b <pr_branch> to create a new branch for the final PR git push --set-upstream origin <pr_branch> Merge the edits but be sure to remove the history of your local commits git merge --squash <temp_branch> git commit -m \"Message\" Now you have a clean single commit from which you can create the PR on the Tasmota Github.","title":"Managing a Forked Branch"},{"location":"Sensor-API/#directoryfile-structure","text":"Sensor libraries are located in the lib/ directory.

It can be useful for anything that you need to do on a per second basis and is commonly used as an entry point to detect a driver or initialize an externally driven device such as a sensor, relay board or other forms of input/output required by your driver. You would normally want to make sure you've detected and initialised before it is used by JSON_APPEND , etc. so that its ready to serve data. The generally accepted way to use this would be to detect your sensor and once this is done set a sensor value accordingly so that the function does not use unnecessary resources during future calls, for example: void MySensorDetect () { if ( MySensorDetected ) { return ; } /* * Perform the code which needs to be completed to * detect your sensor and then set MySensorDetected to * a non-zero value which will prevent this section * of your code to re-run every time the function is * called. * * Under normal circumstances you'd not need to do * re-detect or initialise your sensor once it has been * done */ } Setting a flag that the driver was successful in detecting the attached chip/board via I 2 C or SPI will prevent it from continuously trying to initialize an already initialized device. When writing your function responsible for detecting an externally connected I 2 C device try to create a method by which you read or write to specific registers that would be applicable to that specific I 2 C device only as to confirm a positive detect for the device. If this is not done extensively it will lead to some drivers getting false detects for a different device type simply because it shares the same I 2 C address. Unless your driver is specifically going to use the entire array of addresses provisioned by the manufacturer please consider using a #define USE_MYCHIPNAME_ADDR in the my_user_config.h so that the user may specify the address on which to expect the device. This is of course only applicable to drivers that are not enabled by default in any of the pre-built binaries.

Using the uptime variable for testing like (uptime &1) will happen every 2 seconds. An example is the DS18B20 driver where readings (conversions they call it) can take up to 800mS from the initial request. * If a sensor needed the previous action it is now time to gather the information and store it in a safe place to be used by FUNC_JSON_APPEND and/or FUNC_WEB_APPEND . Using the else function of the previous test (uptime &1) will happen every 2 seconds too but just 1 second later than the previous action. * If a sensor does not respond for 10 times the sensor detection flag could be reset which will stop further processing until the sensor is re-detected. This is currently not being used actively as some users complain about disappearing sensors for whatever reason - Could be hardware related but easier to make Tasmota a little more flexible. * Making re-detection of a sensor possible by executing this once every 100 seconds (94 == (uptime %100)) a re-attached sensor can be detected without a restart of Tasmota. The 94 given in this example should be different for every sensor driver to make sure not all sensors start detection at the same time. Using the drivers index number should be a good starting point.

Flash code is limited to 1024k but keep in mind that to allow OTA upgrade, you need Flash memory to contain two firmwares at the same time. To go beyond 512k, you typically use tasmota-minimal as an intermediate firmware. tasmota-minimal takes roughly 360k, so it's safe not to go uint32_t beyond 620k of Flash. Memory is even more limited: 80k. With Arduino Core and basic Tasmota, there are 25k-30k left of heap space. Heap memory is very precious, running out of memory will generally cause a crash.","title":"Keeping ESP8266 code compact"},{"location":"Sensor-API/#about-esp8266","text":"ESP8266 is based on Xtensa instruction set .

It does not contain an FPU for floating point operations, nor integer divisions. Contrary to classical RISC processors, all instructions are 24 bits wide instead of 32 bits. To increase code compactness, some instructions have a 16 bits version used whenever possible by gcc. If you want to see what assembly is generated by gcc, in file platform.ini , at the section used to compile (ex: [core_2_6_1] ) in section build_flags add: -save-temps=obj -fverbose-asm Gcc will store <file>.s in the same folder as the .o file, typically in .pioenvs/ .","title":"About ESP8266"},{"location":"Sensor-API/#first-example","text":"Let's take a basic function: uint32_t Example ( uint32_t a , uint32_t b ) { return a + b ; } Below is the generated assembly.

Whenever you allocate uint8_t as a local variable, it will anyways allocate 32 bits on the stack. In conclusion you can easily use uint32_t in many places in the code. The main reason to force uint8_t are: in structures, to save memory. This is the only place where uint8_t will take 1 byte and the compiler will try to pack as much as 4 uint8_t in 32 bits when you want to ensure that the value can never exceed 255.

The linker removes any unused functions, so we need to limit the number of floating point function calls. Rule 1 : use ints where you can, avoid floating point operations. Rule 2 : if you really need floating point, always use float , never ever use double . Let's now see why. float fits in 32 bits, with a mantissa of 20 bits, exponent of TODO.

There are multitudes of variants and use cases. A meter can be defined by using compilation time #define pragmas. This requires recompiling the firmware to make modifications. This interface provides a means of specifying these definitions through meter descriptors . This method uses the scripting language editor to define the descriptors. In this way, only one firmware binary version is required and a modification can be made easily \"on the fly\". Note If no >M section is found in the script or if the scripting language is not compiled, the driver reverts to the default #define definition(s). Note Additional hardware is required to read certain measuring devices. For example: RS485toTTL Adaper for Modbus, IR transistor for electricity meters. Sometimes an additional IR diode and resistors. Descriptor Syntax ~ This section must be present, but empty. In most cases, there is no need to define variables for this driver. >D Declare a script >B (boot) section to inform the interface to read the meter descriptor(s) >B => sensor53 r Declare a script >M section with the number of connected meters (n = 1..5 ) >M <n> Meter Declaration ~ +<M>,<rxGPIO>,<type>,<flag>,<parameter>,<jsonPrefix>{,<txGPIO>,<txPeriod>,<cmdTelegram>} Example +1,3,o,0,9600,OBIS1,1,2,2F3F210D0A +1,3,s,16,9600,SML1 +1,12,c,1,-10,H20_Cnt +1,3,m,0,9600,MODBUS,1,1,01040000,01040002,01040004,01040006,01040008,0104000a,0104000c,0104000e,01040010 +<M>,<rxGPIO>,<type>,<flag>,<parameter>,<jsonPrefix>{,<txGPIO>,<txPeriod>,<cmdTelegram>} - <M> - meter number.

Can help with sporadic dropouts eg. reading errors. (not available for counters) - <parameter> - parameters according to meter type: - for o,s,e,m,r : serial baud rate eg. 9600 - for c : - positive value >0 = counter poll interval - negative value <=0 = debounce time (milliseconds) for irq driven counters - <jsonPrefix> - prefix for Web UI and MQTT JSON payload. Up to 7 characters - <txGPIO> - meter command transmit GPIO (optional) - <txPeriod> - number of 100ms increments (n * 100ms). Period to repeat the transmission of commands to the meter (optional) - <cmdTelegram> - comma separated hex coded byte blocks to send to meter device. For modbus each comma separated block is a command to retrieve a certain register from the meter (Optional, only required for measuring devices that have to be triggered with a certain character string.) Modbus: Example +1,3,m,0,9600,MODBUS,1,1,01040000,01040002,01040004,01040006,01040008,0104000a,0104000c,0104000e,01040010 Components of the character string: ...01040000,01040002,... 01 = Modbus slave device ID 04 = Instruction to read an Input Register (alternatively, 03 = Instruction to read an Holding Register) 0000 / 0002 = Register # (as Hexadecimal codification, without the prefix 0x . Example: 0x0079 -> 0079 ) the number of requested registers is fixed to 2, however with the char 'r' before the hex string the complete request string may be specified ...r010400000001,r010400020003,... Note ID , Instruction to read the Register value (Input vs Holding) and Register # may differ depending on the measuring device. Meter Metrics ~ Each meter typically provides multiple metrics (voltage, power, current etc.) which it measures. An entry for each metric to be collected must be specified. up to 20 entries may be defined (default or #define SML_MAX_VARS N a larger number may be defined in user_config_override.h file). An entry defines how to decode the data and put it into variables. Example (OBIS/SML/MODBus): 1,1-0:1.8.1\\*255(@1,Total consumption,KWh,Total_in,4 1,77070100010801ff@1000,W1,kWh,w1,4 1,010304UUuuxxxxxxxx@i0:1,Spannung L1,V,Voltage_L1,0 <M>,<decoder>@<scale>,<label>,<UoM>,<var>,<precision> - <M> - meter number to which this decoder belongs - <decoder> - decoding specification. Decode OBIS as ASCII; SML, EBUS, MODBus, RAW as HEX ASCII - OBIS: ASCII OBIS code terminated with ( character which indicates the start of the meter value - SML: SML binary OBIS as hex terminated with 0xFF indicating start of SML encoded value - EBUS, MODBus, RAW: hex values of EBUS, MODBus, RAW block to compare - xx means ignore value (1 byte) - ss = extract a signed byte - uu = extract an unsigned byte - UUuu = extract an unsigned word (high order byte first) - uuUU = extract an unsigned word (low order byte first) - UUuuUUuu = extract an unsigned long word (high order byte first) - SSss = extract a signed word (high order byte first) - ssSS = extract a signed word (low order byte first) - SSssSSss = extract an signed long word (high order byte first) - ffffffff = extract a float value - FFffFFff = extract a reverse float value - @ decoding definition termination character - decoding a 0/1 bit is indicated by a @ character followed by bx: (x = 0..7 ) extracting the corresponding bit from a byte. e.g.: 1,xxxx5017xxuu@b0:1,Solarpump,,Solarpump,0 - in the case of MODBus , ix: designates the index (x = 0..n ) referring to the requested block in the transmit section of the meter definition Example +1,3,M,1,9600,SBC,1,2,01030023,01030028... 1,010304UUuuxxxxxxxx@i0:1,Voltage L1,V,Voltage_L1,0 < the i0:1 refers to: 01030023 with a scaling factor ( :1 ) of 1 1,010304UUuuxxxxxxxx@i1:10,Current L1,V,Current_L1,2 < the i1:10 refers to: 01030028 with a scaling factor ( :10 ) of 10 - <scale> - scaling factor (divisor) This can be a fraction (e.g., 0.1 => result * 10), or a negative value When decoding a string result (e.g., a serial meter), use # character for this parameter (only in one line per meter). For OBIS, you need a ) termination character after the # character Example: OBIS: 1,1-0:0.0.0\\*255(@#),Meter Nr,, Meter_number,0 SML: 1,77078181c78203ff@#,Service ID,,Meter_id,0 - <label> - web UI label (max 23 chars) if this label is the single char '*' the WEB UI is discarded for this line - <UoM> - unit of measure (max 7 chars) - <var> - MQTT variable name (max 23 chars) - <precision> - number of decimal places Add 16 to transmit the data immediately. Otherwise it is transmitted on TelePeriod Example 1,1-0:1.8.0*255(@1,consumption,KWh,Total_in,4 > Transmitted on TelePeriod 1,1-0:1.8.0*255(@1,consumption,KWh,Total_in,20 > Precision of 4. 4 + 16 = 20 >transmit its value immediately # character terminates the list Note in the decoding section of the meter defintions before the @ char no space chars are allowed Special Commands With the '=' char at the beginning of a line you may do some special decoding M,=m perform arithmetic ( +,-,*,/ ) on the metric. Use # before a number to designate a constant value Example 1,=m 3+4+5/#3 @100,Voltage L1+L2+L3/3,V,Volt_avg,2 1,=m 3+4+5/#3 add result of decoder entry 3,4,5 and divided by 3 (i.e., average) - M,=d calculate difference between metric values decoded at time intervals (up to 10 =d lines possible) Example 1,=d 3 10 calculate 10 second interval difference of decoder entry 3 - M,=h html text (up to 30 chars) inserts a html line between entries (these lines do not count as decoder entry) Example 1,=h================== insert a separator line With an asterisk * character replacing the name in a descriptor line, this line can be hidden in the main menu. (\"#define USE_SML_SCRIPT_CMD\" required) Example 1,010304ffffffff@i0:1,*,V,Voltage_L1-N,2 1,010304ffffffff@i1:1,*,V,Voltage_L2-N,2 1,010304ffffffff@i2:1,*,V,Voltage_L3-N,2 etc... With an asterisk * character as JSON Prefix in the Meter definiton suppresses the JSON output (\"#define USE_SML_SCRIPT_CMD\" required) Example +1,14,m,0,9600,*,12,2,01040000,01040002,01040004 To get the value of one of the descriptor lines, use sml[X]. X = Line number. Starts with 1. (\"#define USE_SML_SCRIPT_CMD\" required) Example >D v1=0 v2=0 >S ;Writes the value of Descriptorline 1 to v1 v1=sml[1] ;Writes the value of Descriptorline 2 to v2 v2=sml[2] Tip Use: sensor53 dM to output the received data in the console. M = the number of the defined meter in the script. Note During the output of the data in the console, the data in the WEB UI are not updated. To return write: sensor53 d0 Warning With a few meters, it is necessary to request the meter to send its data using a specific character string. This string has to be send at a very low baudrate. (300Baud) If you reply the meter with an acknowledge and ask the it for a new baudrate of 9600 baud, the baudrate of the SML driver has to be changed, too. To change the baudrate: sml( METERNUMBER 0 BAUDRATE ) For sending a specific character string: sml( METERNUMBER 1 STRING ) That works like this: Example >D res=0 scnt=0 ;For this Example in the >F section >F ;count 100ms scnt+=1 switch scnt case 6 ;set sml driver to 300 baud and send /?! as HEX to trigger the Meter res=sml(1 0 300) res=sml(1 1 \"2F3F210D0A\") ;1800ms later > Send ACK and ask for switching to 9600 baud case 18 res=sml(1 1 \"063035300D0A\") ;2000ms later > Switching sml driver to 9600 baud case 20 res=sml(1 0 9600) ;Restart sequence after 50x100ms case 50 ; 5000ms later > restart sequence scnt=0 ends >M 1 +1,3,o,0,9600, ,1 ...etc. You can find the example here. Attention This procedure is only necessary, if the meter explicitly asks for 300 baud. The most meters work directly with 9600 baud. Therefore it is easier to give this method a try: Example Meter#,GPIO# Input,TYPE,FLAG,Baudrate,JSONNAME,GPIO# Output,TX Period,Character string + 1,3, o, 0,9600, energy, 1,4,2F3F210D0A Example: here.

M = the number of the defined meter in the script. Note During the output of the data in the console, the data in the WEB UI are not updated. To return write: sensor53 d0 Warning With a few meters, it is necessary to request the meter to send its data using a specific character string. This string has to be send at a very low baudrate. (300Baud) If you reply the meter with an acknowledge and ask the it for a new baudrate of 9600 baud, the baudrate of the SML driver has to be changed, too. To change the baudrate: sml( METERNUMBER 0 BAUDRATE ) For sending a specific character string: sml( METERNUMBER 1 STRING ) That works like this: Example >D res=0 scnt=0 ;For this Example in the >F section >F ;count 100ms scnt+=1 switch scnt case 6 ;set sml driver to 300 baud and send /?! as HEX to trigger the Meter res=sml(1 0 300) res=sml(1 1 \"2F3F210D0A\") ;1800ms later > Send ACK and ask for switching to 9600 baud case 18 res=sml(1 1 \"063035300D0A\") ;2000ms later > Switching sml driver to 9600 baud case 20 res=sml(1 0 9600) ;Restart sequence after 50x100ms case 50 ; 5000ms later > restart sequence scnt=0 ends >M 1 +1,3,o,0,9600, ,1 ...etc. You can find the example here. Attention This procedure is only necessary, if the meter explicitly asks for 300 baud. The most meters work directly with 9600 baud.

With Sonoff DIY , a user has more control over the hardware features of the device and also allows for upgrading the firmware without additional hardware. The following procedure upgrades Sonoff eWelink firmware to Tasmota. There are many reports this procedure has changed with newer versions of Sonoff DIY Tasmota does not provide any kind of support for flashing using this method. Please contact Sonoff Support for help. IMPORTANT: There are some reports suggesting that the Windows version of Sonoff DIY Tool contains a trojan. It is not clear if it actually contains the malicious code or these are just false positives due to the way Python code was converted to native executables. Nevertheless, proceed with care. Compatible devices ~ Currently the following devices officially support Sonoff DIY: - Sonoff Basic R3 - Sonoff RF R3 - Sonoff Mini As Sonoff DIY is enabled by connecting GPIO16 to GND it may well be possible that other Sonoff devices running eWelink will support it. Note The OTA process Sonoff provides through the Sonoff DIY procedure does not create a backup of the Itead firmware on the device. If you use this OTA method to flash Tasmota on the Sonoff device, you will not be able to revert to the original factory firmware. Flash procedure ~ Guide originally from @Brunas Follow instructions how to enter DIY mode from Sonoff . This is the excerpt from it: Power on; Long press the button for 5 seconds for entering Compatible Pairing Mode (AP) User tips: If the device has been paired with eWeLink APP, reset the device is necessary by long press the pairing button for 5 seconds, then press another 5 seconds for entering Compatible Pairing Mode (AP) The LED indicator will blink continuously; From mobile phone or PC WiFi setting, an Access Point of the device named ITEAD-XXXXXXXX will be found, connect it with default password 12345678 Open the browser and access http://10.10.7.1/ Next, Fill in WiFi SSID and password that the device would have connected with Succeed, Now the device is in DIY mode. Note: I needed to manually change IP address to 10.10.7.2, 255.0.0.0 with gateway 10.10.7.1 in adapter TCP/IPv4 settings to access that IP address. Use Fing or any similar local network scanning app on your smartphone or PC to find IP address of your Sonoff Mini device. MAC Vendor most likely is Espressif and the device has 8081 port open. Install Rester extension in Chrome or Firefox or any other preferred tool to perform REST API operations.

Please refer to the general discussion in Securing-your-IoT-from-hacking Starting version 6.5.0.15, there are major changes to TLS to make it lighter in memory and easier to use. It has now reduced flash and memory requirements that makes it compatible with Web and Hue Emulation. If you are upgrading from a previous TLS activated version, there are breaking changes in the way Fingerprints are calculated At the Tasmota configuration, you need to enable to use the TLS Version. This is done by enable #define USE_MQTT_TLS in user_config_override.h and If you are using LetsEncrypt to generate your server certificates, you should activate #define USE_MQTT_TLS_CA_CERT . Tasmota will transparently check the server's certificate with LetsEncrypt CA. If you are generating self-signed certificates or prefer fingerprints, read below. Fingerprint Validation ~ The fingerprint is now calculated on the server's Public Key and no longer on its Certificate. The good news is that Public Keys tend to change far less often than certificates, i.e. LetsEncrypt triggers a certificate renewal every 3 months, the Public Key fingerprint will not change after a certificate renewal. The bad news is that there is no openssl command to retrieve the server's Public Key fingerprint, although a tool exists to calculate it from your certificate. So to simplify your task, we have added two more options: 1/ auto-learning of the fingerprint, 2/ disabling of the fingerprint validation altogether. Option 1: Fingerprint auto-learn If set, Tasmota will automatically learn the fingerprint during the first connection and will set the Fingerprint settings to the target fingerprint. To do so, use one of the following commands: MqttFingerprint1 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 or MqttFingerprint2 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Option 2: Disable Fingerprint You can completely disable server fingerprint validation, which means that Tasmota will not check the server's identity. This also means that your traffic can possibly be intercepted and read/changed, so this option should only be used on trusted networks, i.e. with an MQTT on your local network. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! To do so, set one of the Fingerprints to all 0xFF: MqttFingerprint2 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF Limitations ~ Starting with 6.5.0.15, AxTLS has been replaced with BearSSL . This uses less memory, typically 6.0k constantly, and an additional 6.8k during TLS connection. This makes TLS compatible with Web and Hue/Wemo emulation. Main limitations are: Your SSL/TLS server must support TLS 1.2 and the RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher - which is the case with the default Mosquitto configuration The server certificate must have an RSA private key (max 2048 bits) and the certificate must be signed with RSA and SHA256 hash. This is the case with default LetsEncrypt certificates. Your SSL/TLS should support TLS 1.2 MFLN to limit buffer to 1024 bytes. If MFLN is not supported, it will still work well, as long as the server does not send any message above 1024 bytes (which should be ok, since Tasmota cannot parse MQTT messages above 1024 bytes) Implementation Notes ~ Arduino Core switched from AxTLS to BearSSL in 2.4.2, allowing further optimization of the TLS library footprint. BearSSL is designed for compactness, both in code size and memory requirements. Furthermore it is modular and allows for inclusion of only the code necessary for the subset of crypto-algorithms you want to support. Thanks to BearSSL's compactness and aggressive optimization, the minimal TLS configuration requires just 34.5k of Flash and 6.7k of Memory . The full-blown AWS IoT version with full certificate validation requires 48.3k of Flash and 9.4k of Memory. Here are the tips and tricks used to reduce Flash and Memory: MFLN (Maximum Fragment Length Negotiation): TLS normally uses 16k buffers for send and receive. 32k looks very small on a server, but immensely huge for ESP8266. TLS 1.2 introduced MFLN, which allows the TLS Client to reduce both buffers down to 512 bytes. MFLN is not widely supported yet, but it is by recent OpenSSL versions and by AWS IoT. This is a huge improvement in memory footprint. If your server does not support MFLN, it will still work as long as the messages sent by the server do not exceed the buffer length. In Tasmota the buffer length is 1024 bytes for send buffer and 1024 bytes for receive buffer. Going below creates message fragmentation and much longer TLS connection times (above 3s). If your server does not support MFLN, you'll see a message to that effect in the logs. Max Certificate size : BearSSL normally supports server certificates of up to RSA 4096 bits and EC 521 bits. These certificates are very uncommon currently. To save extra memory, the included BearSSL library is trimmed down to maximum RSA 2048 bit certificate and EC 256 bit certificate. This should not have any impact for you. EC private key : AWS IoT requires the client to authenticate with its own Private Key and Certificate. By default AWS IoT will generate an RSA 2048 bit private key. In Tasmota, we moved to an EC (Elliptic Curve) Private Key of 256 bits. EC keys are much smaller, and handshake is significantly faster. Note: the key being 256 bits does not mean it's less secure than RSA 2048, it's actually the opposite. Single Cipher : to reduce code size, we only support a single TLS cipher and embed only the code strictly necessary. When using TLS (e.g. LetsEncrypt on Mosquitto) the supported cipher is RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 which is a very commonly supported cipher. For AWS IoT, the only supported cipher is ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 which is one of the recommended ciphers. Additionally, ECDHE offers Perfect Forward Secrecy which means extra security. Adaptive Thunk Stack : BearSSL does not allocate memory on its own. It's either the caller's responsibility or memory is taken on the Stack. Stack usage can go above 5k, more than the ESP8266 stack. Arduino created a Thunk Stack , a secondary stack of 5.6k, allocated on Heap, and activated when a TLS connection is active. Actually the stack is mostly used during TLS handshake, and much less memory is required during TLS message processing. Tasmota only allocates the Thunk Stack during TLS handshake and switches back to the normal Stack afterwards. See below for details of actual memory usage. Keys and CA in PROGMEM : BearSSL was adapted from original source code to push most on the tables and static data into PROGMEM: https://github.com/earlephilhower/bearssl-esp8266. Additional work now allows us to put the Client Private Key, Certificate and CA in PROGMEM too, saving at least 3k of Memory. Memory Usage ~ TLS on Tasmota has been aggressively optimized to use as little memory (heap) as possible. It was also optimized to limit code size. Memory consumption (nominal): BearSSL lib: 1424 bytes (or 1024 bytes with LetsEncrypt or regular TLS) BearSSL ClientContext: 3440 bytes Buffers (1024 bytes in + 1024 bytes out + overhead): 2528 bytes Total = 7.4k (or 7.0k with LetsEncrypt or regular TLS) Note: if you use USE_WEBSERVER , your impact is lowered by 2k since the Web log buffer is reduced from 4k to 2k. Overall, when activating USE_WEBSERVER , you just see a memory impact of 5.4k. Memory needed during connection (TLS handshake - fingerprint validation): ThunkStack = 5308 bytes (or 3608 bytes with LetsEncrypt or regular TLS) DecoderContext = 1152 bytes Total for connection = 6.5k (or 4.8k with LetsEncrypt or regular TLS) Memory needed during connection (TLS handshake - full CA validation): ThunkStack = 5308 bytes (or 3608 bytes with LetsEncrypt or regular TLS) DecoderContext = 3072 bytes Total for connection = 8.4k (or 6.7k with LetsEncrypt or regular TLS) Connection Time ~ ESP8266 is quite slow compared to modern processors when it comes to SSL handshakes. Here are observed performance times when connecting to an SSL/TLS server, depending on CPU frequency (80MHz or 160MHz): AWS IoT Connection, with EC Private Key, simple fingerprint validation: 0.7s at 160MHz 1.3s at 80 MHz AWS IoT Connection, with EC Private Key, full CA validation (easier to configure than fingerprints): 1.0s at 160MHz 1.8s at 80 MHz LetsEncrypt based server (Mosquitto for ex), simple fingerprint validation: 0.3s at 160MHz 0.4s at 80MHz LetsEncrypt based server (Mosquitto for ex), with full CA validation (easier to configure than fingerprint): 0.4s at 160MHz 0.7s at 80MHz TLS Troubleshooting ~ Here are most common TLS errors: Error code Description -1004 Missing CA -1003 Missing EC private key -1002 Cannot connect to TCP port -1001 Cannot resolve IP address -1000 Out of memory error 1 Bad fingerprint 2 BR_ERR_BAD_STATE 3 BR_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION 4 BR_ERR_BAD_VERSION 5 BR_ERR_BAD_LENGTH 6 BR_ERR_TOO_LARGE 7 BR_ERR_BAD_MAC 8 BR_ERR_NO_RANDOM 9 BR_ERR_UNKNOWN_TYPE 10 BR_ERR_UNEXPECTED 12 BR_ERR_BAD_CCS 13 BR_ERR_BAD_ALERT 14 BR_ERR_BAD_HANDSHAKE 15 BR_ERR_OVERSIZED_ID 16 BR_ERR_BAD_CIPHER_SUITE 17 BR_ERR_BAD_COMPRESSION 18 BR_ERR_BAD_FRAGLEN 19 BR_ERR_BAD_SECRENEG 20 BR_ERR_EXTRA_EXTENSION 21 BR_ERR_BAD_SNI 22 BR_ERR_BAD_HELLO_DONE 23 BR_ERR_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: the server's public key is too large.

For AWS IoT, the only supported cipher is ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 which is one of the recommended ciphers. Additionally, ECDHE offers Perfect Forward Secrecy which means extra security. Adaptive Thunk Stack : BearSSL does not allocate memory on its own. It's either the caller's responsibility or memory is taken on the Stack. Stack usage can go above 5k, more than the ESP8266 stack. Arduino created a Thunk Stack , a secondary stack of 5.6k, allocated on Heap, and activated when a TLS connection is active. Actually the stack is mostly used during TLS handshake, and much less memory is required during TLS message processing. Tasmota only allocates the Thunk Stack during TLS handshake and switches back to the normal Stack afterwards. See below for details of actual memory usage. Keys and CA in PROGMEM : BearSSL was adapted from original source code to push most on the tables and static data into PROGMEM: https://github.com/earlephilhower/bearssl-esp8266. Additional work now allows us to put the Client Private Key, Certificate and CA in PROGMEM too, saving at least 3k of Memory.","title":"Implementation Notes"},{"location":"TLS/#memory-usage","text":"TLS on Tasmota has been aggressively optimized to use as little memory (heap) as possible.

The creation of a client driver interface implemented since Tasmota 7.0.0.2 enables this possibility. This feature is not included in precompiled binaries To use it you must compile your build . Add the following to user_config_override.h : #ifndef USE_TASMOTA_CLIENT #define USE_TASMOTA_CLIENT // Enable the driver #endif #ifndef USE_TASMOTA_CLIENT_FLASH_SPEED #define USE_TASMOTA_CLIENT_FLASH_SPEED 57600 // Configure the baud rate of the bootloader #endif #ifndef USE_TASMOTA_CLIENT_SERIAL_SPEED 57600 #define USE_TASMOTA_CLIENT_SERIAL_SPEED 57600 // Configure the baud rate at which the client microcontroller will be interfacing to Tasmota #endif Please note that the USE_TASMOTA_CLIENT_FLASH_SPEED will depend on the variant of Arduino Uno/Mini/Nano board you are using - The general observation is that the 3.3V devices usually run at 57600 whereas the 5V devices usually run on 115200 but this is provided for guidance only as it has been found that some boards will not necessarily adhere to this. The main driving factor behind the baud rate is the crystal oscillator on the board which is usually 8Mhz for 3.3V variants and 16Mhz for 5V variants - hence 57600 being 1/2 of 115200. It should also be noted that this option is only really applicable if you're actually using an Arduino UNO/Mini/Nano as a client device and you want to be able to update the firmware on the Arduino OTA via the Tasmota Web UI. If you are using another type of microcontroller, obviously the OTA update functionality will not work (for now, until support is added for other microcontrollers). But if you are able to program the device manually there is no reason why you cannot use any microcontroller or development board as a client to your Tasmota powered ESP8266/8285 hardware. Once you have compiled your own variant with the correct settings and flashed the self-compiled binary to your Tasmota device it is time to make the necessary configuration within Tasmota. Configuring Tasmota to use the TasmotaClient functionality ~ The communication interface between Tasmota and your client micro-controller will be over serial communication. To make this possible you will need to configure two of the GPIO pins to Client TX and Client RX respectively. In addition to this you also need to define the GPIO which will be used to pull the reset pin of your client microcontroller down to GND or up to 3.3V, so either Client RST for normal reset behaviour (active low) or Client RSTi for inverted reset behaviour (active high) As mentioned above it is possible to connect any microcontroller of your choice but for the purpose of this article, only the implementation of an Arduino Pro Mini (3.3V) will be covered. Getting things wired up ~ With Tasmota GPIO configuration provided above you may now proceed to make the necessary electrical connections between the ESP8266/ESP8285 and your client device, for example: ESP8266 Arduino Pro Mini (3.3V) VCC VCC GND GND D2 (GPIO4) RX (0) D1 (GPIO5) TX (1) D4 (GPIO2) Reset (RST) So to visualize the above: Please verify your specific board's pin naming as they are not always exactly the same depending on where they came from! Compiling a test sketch for the client ~ The TasmotaClient driver requires your client to operate within specific parameters allowed by the driver itself so head over to the TasmotaClient Library and install the library in your local Arduino development environment. Once installed you should be able to access the examples from the menu system: Make sure you have the correct board and speed selected: Now that everything is set, it's time to export the compiled binary by selecting it from the Arduino menu: Once completed head over to the known folder you chose in previous steps and locate the .hex file which should be in the same folder as where your sketch was originally saved to. You will most likely see a file listing like this: You are interested in Blink.ino.eightanaloginputs.hex and can ignore the one which has bootloader as part of the file name since the Arduino Pro Mini already has the bootloader flashed. Take note of the location and name of this file as you will need it in the next step to upload the compiled file to your client device. Uploading a new hex file to your client device ~ If you are using an Arduino Pro Mini as is the case in this example you would have created a .hex file in the previous step. This file can be flashed directly to the Arduino Pro Mini via the Tasmota Web UI. Navigate to the Firmware Upgrade page where you would normally upload a new binary file to upgrade Tasmota. The same method is used to upload a HEX file to the client device. Tasmota will automatically decide where it will flash the upload based on whether you're uploading a .bin file or a .hex file. Tasmota will prompt you for the firmware file you wish to upload - You need to navigate to the previously known location folder you chose in earlier steps and select the .hex file previously identified: After selecting the hex file you may proceed to click the Start Upgrade button: The hex file will upload to Tasmota and Tasmota will flash the new client firmware onto the Arduino Pro Mini and present you with the following web page: After the device completes a restart you should now have an Arduino Pro Mini running as a client where the blink is controlled from Tasmota's internal one-second callback.","title":"TasmotaClient"},{"location":"TasmotaClient/#configuring-tasmota-to-use-the-tasmotaclient-functionality","text":"The communication interface between Tasmota and your client micro-controller will be over serial communication.

Templates provide an easy way for you to create, modify and share configurations for various devices that have features supported in Tasmota. To provide easy processing by Tasmota a template is written as a JSON string and could look like this: { \"NAME\" : \"UserModule1\" , \"GPIO\" :[ 17 , 148 , 29 , 149 , 7 , 255 , 255 , 255 , 138 , 255 , 139 , 255 , 255 ], \"FLAG\" : 0 , \"BASE\" : 18 } Tip Tasmota Device Templates Repository has a complete list of supported devices. We encourage everyone who creates a template for a new unknown device to submit it using Add New Template form . How to Use ~ Go to Configuration - Configure Template ... ... and you'll end up looking at this screen. Time to create your template. Creating Your Template ~ Change the template name (also defines the name for the module). Select a module to BASE your template on . If you're not sure, Module 18 is the best choice. In this example the device is based on Blitzwolf SHP (45) module. Configure the components assigned to the GPIOs to match your device. If you do not know what pins your device uses, read about the new device configuration procedure to determine the correct pin assignments. Any unused GPIO that has cannot have a peripheral connected should be set to None (0) . In our example the device has no exposed GPIO's so the unused ones are set to 0 compared to the original BlitzWolf module. GPIOs that can have peripherals connected to (exposed GPIOs) should be set to User (255) . This allows future configuration through the Configure Module dialog without the need to create a new template. Example Sonoff TH has a jack connected to GPIO4 that allows a user to plug in a sensor. Assigning GPIO4 as 255 allows a Template to have correct GPIOs for this device even if nothing is plugged in. But, when a user decides to connect a sensor using the jack, GPIO4 can be set to the type of sensor through the Configure Module page. Click on Save and you'll see this message Finally, the device will reboot with the new template name Exporting Your Template ~ Now that you've set up your previously unsupported device in Tasmota it is time to share the knowledge: Check that Module 0 is selected in the Configuration - Configure Module menu. Open up Console and issue command Template which will output a string with the configuration of your currently active template. Our example gives the following: MQT: stat/tasmota/RESULT = { \"NAME\" : \"RGB Smart Plug\" , \"GPIO\" :[ 37 , 0 , 39 , 0 , 38 , 134 , 0 , 0 , 131 , 17 , 132 , 21 , 0 ], \"FLAG\" : 0 , \"BASE\" : 45 } Copy the string {\"NAME\":\"RGB Smart Plug\",\"GPIO\":[37,0,39,0,38,134,0,0,131,17,132,21,0],\"FLAG\":0,\"BASE\":45} and share it on the Tasmota Device Templates Repository . Importing Templates ~ Go to Configuration - Configure Other When there: Paste the template string into the Template field Make sure you check Activate Click on Save . The device will reboot with a name reflecting your template name and Module 0 selected which has your new template stored. If your device was previously configured you will have to manually change to Module 0 in * Configuration -> Configure Module * . Commands ~ A user provided template can be stored in Tasmota using the Template command. It has the following parameters. Parameter Description Show current Template 0 Create template from active module 1..71 Create template from a supported module { ... } Store template written in a JSON string 255 Merge configured template and current module Template {\"NAME\":\"UserModule1\",\"GPIO\":[17,148,29,149,7,255,255,255,138,255,139,255,255],\"FLAG\":0,\"BASE\":18} stores a complete template based on the Generic module Template {\"NAME\":\"AnotherModuleName\"} updates the name of a stored template Template {\"FLAG\":0} changes FLAG value Template {\"BASE\":18} updates the base of a stored template to Generic After setting a template in command line it is necessary to issue Module 0 command if the device doesn't reboot on its own. Merge Template with Module You can set up your device in module * Configuration -> Configure Module * and use command Template 255 to merge the settings of the Module with current template into a new Template named \"Merged\". Anatomy of a Template ~ Let's look again at our example template: {\"NAME\":\"UserModule1\",\"GPIO\":[17,148,29,149,7,255,255,255,138,255,139,255,255],\"FLAG\":0,\"BASE\":18} The four properties with UPPERCASE property names have the following functionality: Property name Property value description NAME Up to 60 characters for the Module name GPIO Up to 13 decimal numbers from 0 to 255 representing GPIO0 to GPIO5, GPIO09, GPIO10 and GPIO12 to GPIO16 FLAG 8 bit mask flag register BASE Module number of a hard-coded device to be used when device specific functionality is needed GPIO ~ GPIO order GPIO# |00| 01|02| 03|04| 05| 09| 10| 12| 13| 14| 15| 16| CODE [17,148,29,149,52,255,255,255,138,255,139,255,255] GPIO functionality The GPIO functionality numbers are the same as shown by command GPIOs . In addition code 255 is added to select a GPIO as user configurable via the GUI Configure Module menu. Example In our example the GPIO 00 data element is 17 which corresponds to the Button1 component, according to the following table. If you change that template element to 9 it would then be assigned as a Switch1 component instead. Components See Components for a complete list FLAG ~ Used to configure the ADC type. In most templates this should be set to 0 . FLAG Feature description 0 No features 1 Analog value 2 Temperature 3 Light 4 Button 5 Buttoni 15 User configured (same as GPIO 255 ) BASE ~ BASE is the starting module setup for the custom template.

The produced heat is proportional to the LED intensities, and if it builds up faster than how it dissipates from the chassis, then the temperature will rise. The circuitries usually (but not necessarily ) contain some last-resort countermeasure that shuts down the device when it is critically overheated, but it shouldn't be relied upon. When testing the device for the first time, especially at higher light intensities, monitor its temperature for some time , like for at least half an hour, and if it rises rapidly, then please consider: Reducing the overall brightness Using only one of the light sources (i.e. either the color LEDs, or the high-power white ones) For such a test use an electrically safe lamp in which you can access the bulb, and which you can easily disconnect from the mains anytime. For measuring the temperature the best tool is an IR thermometer: aim it at the heatsink part of the chassis from a direction perpendicular to it, from such a distance that its cone of sensitivity is fully on the chassis. If you choose to test the temperature by hand, then be prepared that it may be hot , so approach it slowly, and if you already feel its heat, then don't touch it . During this check please also consider that a bulb standing on your desk in a test socket has considerably better cooling than one in a closed armature right below your ceiling, so try to 'model' the operating conditions in which you plan to use the device. If you have found a solution that keeps the temperature stable, don't forget to configure a limit in your home automation system so you (or anyone else) won't accidentally set the device to overheating when it'll be already installed. Some of the devices' original firmwares do contain such software throttling, but as the thermal behaviour differs from one model to another, there is no generic way to apply the right amount of throttling that would be both required and enough for everyone, so \"your mileage may vary\". Technical background ~ Light bulb circuitries consist of 3 main stages: A small power supply unit that converts the 230V or 110V mains to approx. 20V for the LEDs and 3.3V for the controller. This is a small switching-mode power supply, but usually of a parsimonius design, so it's usually barely adequate for the average power requirement, and sometimes not enough for the maximum . The main problem is not the transformer, but the voltage regulators: they produce heat proportionally to the current that's drawn through them, and they aren't connected to the heatsink , so all their heat goes just into the air within the bulb. The controller module, usually a SoC that contains the CPU, memory, flash and wifi. It is a logic circuit, its heat production is negligible compared to the other stages. The LED circuitry, meaning the LEDs themselves and their driver chips, usually on a separate board. They produce a lot of heat, but they are always connected to the chassis via either thermal grease or thermally conductive glue. So the problems are: - Voltage regulators produce heat proportional to light intensity - Their thermal coupling to the chassis is terrible: via a huge air gap - The chassis is not an effective heatsink (for aesthetic reasons it can't be) - The overall system is designed for the average conditions and not for the maximum. Thus our goal is to limit the power consumption to such a level that the heat produced can be dissipated by the chassis heatsink, and the way to achieve this is throttling down the light intensity and/or limiting the switched-on time.

To use it, you must compile your build . Add the following to user_config_override.h : #ifndef USE_THERMOSTAT #define USE_THERMOSTAT #endif Control over heating and cooling as a true HVAC unit Thermostat driver allows a Tasmota device, provided it receives the temperature input via MQTT or a locally connected sensor, to follow control heating/cooling strategies to reach the desired setpoint. The thermostat offers similar functions as feature rich commercial ones as the models found below: Typical setup: Heating floor system ~ A typical setup for heating room systems can be found in the picture below. A conventional room thermostat is connected to a heating floor valve actuator, both running at AC voltage (f.i. 220V). The thermostat is connected to neutral as well as to the phase, the actuator to the same neutral connection of the thermostat and to its actuation signal. The actuation signal will switch between the neutral voltage (actuation Off) and the phase voltage (actuation On). The conventional room thermostats offer nowadays either 2 point control with hysteresis or a more advanced PI (Proportional-Integral) control. The result of the PI control is typically transformed into a PWM signal with a pre-defined period and a variable duty cycle. Use of tasmota switch to bypass an existing wall thermostat ~ A tasmota switch can be installed in a way that it bypasses the existing wall thermostat. The advantage of this setup is that the thermostat driver offers the possibility to follow the output of the existing wall thermostat or acting autonomously. This setup allows a seamless integration with existing wall thermostats and gives the user the freedom to still use them. Below you can find an example of a Shelly switch bypassing a wall thermostat: Configuration for standalone application or bypass of existing wall thermostat ~ The driver by default does not consider the input switch states even if available and its therefore suitable for standalone use. If the application requires to follow the command of the input once active (see bypass setup explained in previous section). This bypass function is specially useful to allow the user to use the device bypassed, in case of a wall thermostat, to allow this thermostat to be used if desired. To enable this bypass function, the following command is to be sent to the tasmota device: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/INPUTSWITCHUSE 1 Note Some devices (such as the Sonoff 4CH Pro R2) even if having input buttons to manually switch the state of the output, report always its inputs in active state no matter if the button is pressed or not. For these devices the parameter above needs to be set to 0, otherwise the thermostat driver will activate the output continuously and stay permanently in manual mode. Once active, the thermostat, in case of its input being active, will switch to manual mode and set as output the same state of its input. The thermostat will switch back from manual to automatic mode after a defined time where the input is inactive. The following parameter can be set to modify the time window in minutes to switch back to automatic in case the input is inactive: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TIMEMANUALTOAUTOSET 60 The default value for the time window to switch from manual to automatic is 60 minutes. Temperature input / setpoint ~ Local temperature sensor ~ The tasmota driver can receive the temperature either via the related MQTT command or via a local temperature sensor (see example of a DS18B20 temperature sensor and a shelly temperature sensor addon below). The default temperature input is MQTT. The following command can be used to select the local sensor as default input: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/SENSORINPUTSET 1 Note The default local temperature sensor is a DS18B20. In case a different Tasmota supported sensor is used, the following define in my_user_config.h is to be changed (or redefined in user_config_override.h ) and a user specific tasmota software needs to be compiled: #define THERMOSTAT_SENSOR_NAME \"DS18B20\" // Name of the local sensor to be used MQTT temperature value and setpoint ~ The following commands can be used to provide the driver with the temperature value of the room and the desired setpoint: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TEMPTARGETSET 22.5 cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TEMPMEASUREDSET 21.8 Examples for room temperature of 21.8\u00b0C and temperature setpoint of 22.5\u00b0C There are several ways to send the MQTT room temperature. For the development and testing of this driver, a Raspberry Pi with Domoticz and a Z-Wave stick has been used to gather all room temperatures from Z-Wave sensors and send them to the respective Tasmota room thermostats. Customization of the controller for best results ~ The thermostat controller includes a default parameter set that targets a typical floor heating application for mid-sized rooms (< 20m2) with one heating circuit. The controller is however highly configurable via MQTT. The following sections will guide the user to adapt the main parameters to improve the performance of the thermostat controller via customization. Enable the thermostat driver ~ The thermostat driver is by default disabled. To enable it the following command can be used: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/THERMOSTATMODESET 1 Set the controller in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit ~ The default temperature format is degrees Celsius. The format can be easily switched to degrees Fahrenheit via MQTT command, see below: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TEMPFORMATSET 1 Set the control strategy ~ The control strategy by default is a Hybrid one. The hybrid control strategy mixes a so called \"Ramp-Up\" strategy (invention during the development of this driver, initially as a LUA script and ported to Tasmota later) and a PI one. The \"Ramp-Up\" strategy is typically used to reach as fast as possible the setpoint for big deltas between desired temperature and setpoint, the PI on the other hand for most part of the normal thermostat operation. The control strategy can be however modified, if the Hybrid one is not desired, the PI or \"Ramp-Up\" mode, can be forced. For that purpose the following command can be used: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/CONTROLLERMODESET 1 The value 1 forces the PI operation and the value 2 the \"Ramp-Up\" one. PI controller main parameters ~ Cycle time Depending on the heating system, the cycle time (PMW period) can be adapted. Very slow systems (high time constants) such as heating floor systems might need higher values (default value is 30 minutes), faster systems might need smaller cycle times. Below the command to adapt the cycle time can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TIMEPICYCLESET 30 Proportional Band Depending on the dimensioning of your heating system, the proportional band of the controller might be increased (if it takes too long to reach setpoint) or reduced (very high overshoot). The default proportional gain is 4, which means that the duty cycle due to the proportional part of the PI controller will be 100% for temperature deltas between setpoint and room temperature equal or bigger than 4\u00b0C. Below the command to adapt the proportional band can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/PROPBANDSET 1 Note With the command above, the PI controller will output a proportional time equivalent to 100% of the duty cycle for delta temperatures between setpoint and room temp. above 1\u00b0C (f.i. for big rooms with weak dimensioned heating circuit). Reset Time The reset time is the time the PI controller takes to overcome steady-state errors. The default value for the reset time is 1800 seconds. This value can be for instance increased in case a stronger integral reaction of the controller is desired. Below the command to adapt the proportional band can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TIMERESETSET 1800 Temperature for the anti-windup reset To avoid the accummulated error and therefore integral component of the PI controller to grow too much and produce a high overshoot, a temperature delta can be defined within the integrator will work. Outside this range the accummulated error and integral part will be set to 0. The default value for the integrator to work is 0.8\u00b0C. Below the command to adapt the anti-windup temperature can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TEMPANTIWINDUPRESETSET 0.8 Temperature hysteresis A temperature hysteresis can be set to avoid any PI controller actions within a certain value arround the setpoint. The default value for the hysteresis is 0.1\u00b0C. In well configured controller this value should be as low as possible to avoid unwanted temperature oscillations which reduce efficiency and therefore increase costs. Below the command to adapt the anti-windup temperature can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TEMPHYSTSET 0.1 Maximum action of the controller The maximum On time (Duty Cycle) in minutes within a cycle can be set by this parameter. The default value is 20 minutes. This represents for the default cycle time of 30 minutes 2 thirds of the complete cycle. In case the controller takes too long to reach the setpoint, this value can be increased to values closer to the cycle time. Below the command to adapt the maximum action time can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TIMEMAXACTIONSET 20 Minimum action of the controller The minimum On time (Duty Cycle) in minutes within a cycle can be set by this parameter. The default value is 4 minutes. Below the command to adapt the minimum action time can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TIMEMINACTIONSET 4 It is very important to adapt this value to your heating system to obtain accurate temperature control If the value is very low, in case of floor heating systems for instance, the heating actuators might not have enough time to open the valves and the temperature will drop (depending on the actuator open/close time could take from 1 to 3 minutes) if it is too high, there will be unwanted oscillations arround the setpoint. One way to configure this value in heating mode is to manually tune it in worst case conditions (highest typically desired room temperature and lower winter temperature outside) checking that the proportional action generated by the controller is sufficient to raise slightly the temperature. If the temperature still goes down after the pulse plus delay time of the system and rises just once the accumulated error triggers integral actions then the value set is too low. Ramp-Up controller main parameters ~ Temperature delta to get into \"Ramp-Up\" mode When the controller is configured in Hybrid mode (default), the control strategy will be a mix-up between \"Ramp-Up\" (for big deltas between room temperature and setpoint) and PI (arround the setpoint). The following parameter can be set to define at above which delta temperature between measured and setpoint the \"Ramp-Up\" controller shall be active: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TEMPRUPDELTINSET 30 The default value is 0.4\u00b0C. Time passed after latest setpoint change to get into \"Ramp-Up\" mode When the controller is configured in Hybrid mode (default), the activation of the \"Ramp-Up\" mode will not just depend on the defined temperature delta between measured and setpoint, but as well on the time in minutes passed since the last setpoint change occurred. This strategy matches the purpose of the \"Ramp-Up\" controller, which was developed to reach the desired temperature as fast as possible in very specific scenarios, f.i. after a night keeping the room temperature low. In hybrid mode, the controller active most part of the time should be the PI one. The following parameter can be used to define the time to allow switching to \"Ramp-Up\" in minutes. cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TIMEALLOWRAMPUPSET 300 The default value is 300 minutes. Cycle time Depending on the heating system, the cycle time (PMW period) can be adapted. Very slow systems (high time constants) such as heating floor systems might need higher values (default value is 30 minutes), faster systems might need smaller cycle times. Below the command to adapt the cycle time can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TIMERAMPUPCYCLESET 30 Maximum Ramp-Up time The maximum time the ramp-up phase of the controller shall be active can be configured. The default value is 960 minutes. Below the command to adapt this time can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/TIMERAMPUPMAXSET 960 Thermostat persistent storage for configuration ~ The thermostat driver stores all configured parameters over MQTT exclusively in RAM, it does not use flash due to the amount of the parameters. This means that at every restart the default parameters will be set again. To avoid this behavior rules can be set-up to reconfigure desired parameters at every restart. See below an example: ON Power1#boot DO Backlog sensorinputset 1;controllermodeset 2;thermostatmodeset 1;temptargetset %mem1% ENDON ON mqtt#connected DO Publish2 stat/TestTopic/targetTempValue {\"Temp\":%mem1%} ENDON ON mem1#state DO Backlog temptargetset %value%;Publish2 stat/TestTopic/targetTempValue {\"Temp\":%mem1%} ENDON Advanced features ~ Multi-controller ~ The tasmota driver can be compiled to be used in devices with more than one output, allowing independant controllers for each one of the outputs. This feature has been successfully tested with a Sonoff 4CH PRO R2. To increase the number of controller outputs, modify the value of the thermostat controller outputs in my_user_config.h or redefine it in user_config_override.h and compile a customized tasmota software. #define THERMOSTAT_CONTROLLER_OUTPUTS 1 // Number of outputs to be controlled independently Alternative outputs: PWM duty cycle ~ The driver provides the possibility to read the duty cycle in % (0-100) of the actuated relay. Below the command to read the duty cycle can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/CTRDUTYCYCLEREAD The physical switch of the output can as well be disabled via command. Below the command to disable it can be found: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/ENABLEOUTPUTSET 0 Future improvements ~ Cooling ~ The controller offers the possibility to switch from heating to cooling. Due to lack of cooling setup at the time of the development of the driver, this feature has however not been propertly tested. Testers for cooling are therefore welcomed. The following MQTT command can be used to switch from heating (default) to cooling: cmnd/Tasmota_Name/CLIMATEMODESET 1 Self learning process of the \"Ramp-Up\" controller to reduce overshoot ~ The \"Ramp-Up\" controller evaluates the time constant of the system and predicts when to switch off the actuator to reach the desired temperature as fast as possible. This controller offers the best speed to reach the Setpoint. This controller will be improved by a learning process to evaluate how accurate the target value has been reached and therefore minimize gradually the overshoot. This feature will improve the behavior of the current controller which depending on the application and thermal capacity of the system might produce some overshoot. By default the controller set is the Hybrid one, enabling \"Ramp-Up\" for big temperature deltas between Setpoint and measured temperature and PI for smaller ones. If you are not satisfied with the performance of this controller in your system, you can disable it by MQTT and force the use of the PI controller exclusively (see Controller configuration section above). PI Autotune ~ A PI autotune feature following the Zigler-Nichols closed loop algorithm has been implemented. This feature is untested and will be further developed soon. To enable it for testing purposes add the following define in user_config_override.h and compile a customized tasmota software. #define USE_PI_AUTOTUNING // (Ziegler-Nichols closed loop method)","title":"Thermostat"},{"location":"Thermostat/#typical-setup-heating-floor-system","text":"A typical setup for heating room systems can be found in the picture below.

The relay output on a Sonoff device provides (obviously) just on/off control. Often it is desirable to be able to get a value between off and on, for example 25% power. The conventional way to achieve this with devices such as electrical heaters or hot water radiators is to switch the device on for a period and then off for a period. This extension allows a required power value between 0 and 1 to be specified via MQTT and the code will automatically cycle the relay on/off to achieve this power. The s/w is configured with a Cycle Time that specifies the period. So for example if a power value of 0.25 is specified with a cycle time of 12 minutes then the relay will be on for 3 minutes and off for 9 minutes every 12 minute period. The s/w includes a safety mechanism where the maximum time expected between MQTT power updates is specified. If this time is exceeded with no value being received then the power will revert to a specified fallback value. To add the feature into the standard Tasmotta s/w (at least version 5.12.0 is required) then have a look at the timeprop_branch of the tasmota fork at https://github.com/colinl/Sonoff-Tasmota/tree/timeprop_branch . Pick up the three files from there, lib/ProcessControl/Timeprop.cpp and Timeprop.h (which are from this process-control repository ) and sonoff/xdrv_91_timeprop.ino and add them into your Tasmota sources. Instructions for setting it up and using it are in xdrv_91_timeprop.ino . The feature adds about 1.2k to the compiled code. Currently all configuration parameters must be setup at build time.

The logging level is set separately for each log destination. Log levels range from 0 to 5 . The higher the log level, the more information is logged. When troubleshooting your device its recommended to set the logging level to 4 . Web Logging These show up in the Web UI Console (http://deviceip/cs). The default logging level for WebLog logging is 2. Warning Never connect to serial while the device is connected to mains power. You can still collect the logs, but only when powering it via your serial connection. Some devices use the serial port to control the relays or an MCU, so serial logging might interfere with control and even switch relays or lights. The default logging level for SerialLog logging is 2. Unless explicitly set by a command (e.g., user input in the Console, a System#Boot triggered rule), SerialLog will be disabled automatically 10 minutes after the device reboots. Through a terminal program set the baud rate to 115200 (19200 for Sonoff Dual), both NL & CR, and disable hardware flow control. Debugging the Sonoff Pow is a bit tricky as the serial interface has a direct connection to one of the AC power lines . The schematic below uses two optocouplers separating the AC connection on the left from the low voltage connection on the right allowing for serial control at 115200 baud and uploading of firmware up to 57600 baud while AC is connected. Crashdumps If the ESP8266 crashes, it frequently dumps information about the crash out the serial port, so the process listed above to see serial logs can provide extremely useful information Syslog Logging If you have a Linux system, it is probably already running syslog . You just need to configure it to listen on the network. SysLog logging is disabled in Tasmota by default. On systems running rsyslog (most linux distros), edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file. Adding (or uncommenting) the following lines will probably start making the logs show up in some file under /var/log $ModLoad imudp $UDPServerRun 514 If you do not have access to a Linux system, there are Microsoft Windows Syslog server options . MQTT Logging These log messages show up as MQTT messages. MqttLog logging is disabled by default. MQTT traffic ~ To check the flow of MQTT traffic you can use MQTT Explorer which shows your entire MQTT traffic in an organised and structured way. Tasmota Device Manager offers an overview of all your Tasmota devices using MQTT protocol. You can manage them, use device features and do basic troubleshooting with ease. It also cleanly displays if your device is dropping from the network often or reboots unexpectedly. Running out of RAM ~ This typically shows up in the device working when it first starts up (hitting the button toggles the relay), but some time later it either reboots or some function won't work. For example, you can't load the module configuration page. The only fix for this is to recompile the firmware and disable features you don't need.

Program Memory ~ A 512K firmware binary size is a good \"target\" and rule of thumb for allowing future OTA firmware updates. Flashing over the air (OTA) requires that there is enough free program memory available to upload the new firmware along with the existing copy before the old copy is deleted. If your firmware binary is larger than the available free program memory, you can replace the existing firmware with a minimal functionality version of Tasmota (roughly 375K).

The switches range from 1 to 8 gangs. The dimmers are usually 1 gang. They dim mains voltage for various lighting types: incandescent, CFL, and LED. Consult the specific device for the type of bulbs and capacity it supports as well as the bulbs themselves to verify they support dimming. Identification and Technical details ~ The basic identification of a Tuya device is when the device information references the \"Tuya Smart\", \"SmartLife\", or \"Smart Living\" app. These switches and dimmers are based on a Tuya TYWE3S Wi-Fi PCB module along with an MCU. TYWE3S is based on the ESP8266 which is supported by Tasmota. Wiki page for TYWE3S The TYWE3S module mostly takes care of Wi-Fi and software features while the MCU controls the actual hardware (buttons, relays, dimmer, power measurement, etc). The MCU is interfaced to TYWE3S using the serial interface which connects to the Rx and Tx pins. The easiest way to identify if your switch or dimmer uses MCU is by using a continuity tester (multimeter, ohmmeter) and checking continuity from the Rx and Tx pins on TYWE3S to any other chip. Then check the datasheet of that chip to see if it is an MCU. Flashing - Preparation ~ To boot the TYWE3S in flashing mode, GPIO0 needs to be connected to GND while powering up. It can be left grounded for the entire process. Flashing a TYWE3S connected to a MCU is a bit trickier than one without MCU. This is due the same Rx Tx pins used by MCU and serial programmer for flashing. The TYWE3S cannot be booted to flash mode with MCU sending data over the same pins. To be able to do that, we need to disable MCU from sending data over Rx and Tx pins. There are few ways to do it: 1. Disconnect TYWE3S module from the rest of board. (Naah, too much work) 2. Just break the Rx track from MCU to TYWE3S, flash and then reconnect. (Messy work, we want cleaner approach) 3. Just keep MCU disabled while flashing TYWE3S without any soldering / cutting. (We like that) The easiest is to keep MCU disabled is by identifying the NRST/RST (Reset) pin of the MCU from its datasheet and connect it to GND for the entire flashing process. This will keep MCU disabled while you flash TYWE3S. If there are some contacts or test points in switches that connect to the MCU, you might be lucky to find contacts for RST that you can easily solder onto. TYWE3S Connection Options ~ 3D print a flashing Jig and use pogo pins to make nice and easy to use flashing jig Solder wires directly onto TYWE3S Use a jumper header like the one below and bend the pins to match VCC, Rx Tx GPIO0 and GND. You can just press the jumper header to the contacts during the flashing process Flashing - Process ~ Once you are done identifying the pins and ready to connect, BEFORE connecting USB to PC you need to connect them as follows: NOTE : Use 3.3V NOT 5V TYWE3S Serial Programmer RX TX TX RX GPIO0 GND GND GND VCC 3.3V If an MCU is present, bridge RST to GND on the MCU Use a 6.6.0.10 Tasmota version or higher. There are lots of Tuya Serial fixes / features added in there and the tutorial below expects them. Now you need to follow the commands explained in the flashing tutorial . TIP: If you are using jumper headers use sleep 15 && before your commands, this would free your hand and give you some time to set the jumper pins and connect the USB to PC. Configuration ~ Once Tasmota is flashed on the TYWE3S, just disconnect GND -> GPIO0 (and RST if there is an MCU), and power your device again from USB. On your PC, you should see a Wi-Fi network named sonoff-xxxx where xxxx is a number from the ESP's MAC address. Connect to it and go to 192.168.4.1 in your browser. Enter the Wi-Fi credentials for your network and click save. Connect your PC back to your network. Now you need to find the IP of newly connected Tasmota device. Refer to this very good video from SuperHouseTV (ignore flashing information) about configuring Tasmota. Once you get to the Tasmota configuration you need to select TuyaMCU module assign GPIO components as indicated below depending on your hardware. You already know the pin connections to the MCU. GPIO Component 01 Tuya Rx (108) 03 Tuya Tx (107) 13 Tuya Rx (108) 15 Tuya Tx (107) If the device is connecting fine to your network, now is the time to power it down and re-assemble it. Connect a test bulb (or to the final place if you don't mind testing there) Once this is saved and device is rebooted. Open the Tasmota configuration page and you should be able to use the Toggle button to toggle the dimmer or at least one of the gangs in a multi gang switch. Follow the process here depending on switch or dimmer. Product Specific guides ~ Otim Dimmer ~ This Device is based on a Tuya Wi-Fi Module. Refer to \"MCU Based Tuya Dimmers and Switches\" for details. Flashing and Setup Video Guide These devices use a Tuya TYWE3S Wi-Fi PCB module. Once the switch is carefully popped open you will need to remove the ribbon cables for flashing and ease of soldering. An easy soldering method is to take several Dupont style jumper wires, cut one end off, and apply a bit of solder to each stripped end. This will keep the wire flexible and prevent any circuit board pads from ripping off. Apply a bit of solder to each pad necessary to flash (double check your pin-outs). Once the wire and pad have solder simply put the two together and apply a bit of heat and they will join together. Attach the GPIO0 wire to ground during initial boot to flash. You may need to also connect MCU RST to GND during initial boot to get it into programming mode as described here . A 3-pin header bridged together works great with GPIO0, GND and the GND from the USB flasher attached. (TX pin to RX pin and RX pin to TX pin on USB flash adapter).

Originally, in those devices, the Wi-Fi module takes care of network and software features. Meanwhile, the MCU controls the hardware based on commands received from the Wi-Fi module or built-in controls (buttons, switches, remotes and similar) and reports the status back to the Wi-Fi module. TuyaMCU module facilitates communication between Tasmota and the MCU using Tuya Serial Port Communication Protocol : TuyaMCU command maps device functions to Tasmota components TuyaSend<x> command calculates and sends complex serial commands using only two parameters TuyaReceived MCU response interpreted and publishes as status message and a JSON payload to an MQTT topic Warning Used only if your device is defined as module TuyaMCU (54) . Command value consists of two comma separated parameters: fnId and dpId. TuyaMCU <fnId>,<dpId> Example TuyaMCU 11,1 maps Relay1 (fnId 11) to dpId 1. If any existing entry with same fnId or dpId is already present, it will be updated to the new value. Entry is removed when fnId or dpId is 0 . When no parameters are provided TuyaMCU prints the current mapped values. dpId ~ All the device functions controlled by the MCU are identified by a dpId. Whenever a command is sent to the MCU, this dpId determines which component needs to be controlled and the applies when the status is received from MCU. There is no way to autodetect dpId's and their functions. To assist in the process of determining what dpId does what, there is a bookmarklet available that can be used on the console screen. This will send the weblog and other required commands automatically, and present the TuyaMCU information in a single table allowing for easier testing. Use this procedure to determine which dpId's are available: Go to Configure -> Console option in Tasmota web interface. Use command weblog 4 to enable verbose logging in web interface. Observe the log. After every 9-10 seconds you should see TYA messages. {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA0107000501010001000F\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"0101000100\",\"DpType1Id1\":0,\"1\":{\"DpId\":1,\"DpIdType\":1,\"DpIdData\":\"00\"}}} TYA: fnId=11 is set for dpId=1 TYA: RX Relay-1 --> MCU State: Off Current State:Off {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA01070005020100010010\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"0201000100\",\"DpType1Id2\":0,\"2\":{\"DpId\":2,\"DpIdType\":1,\"DpIdData\":\"00\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=2 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA01070005030100010011\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"0301000100\",\"DpType1Id3\":0,\"3\":{\"DpId\":3,\"DpIdType\":1,\"DpIdData\":\"00\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=3 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA01070005040100010012\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"0401000100\",\"DpType1Id4\":0,\"4\":{\"DpId\":4,\"DpIdType\":1,\"DpIdData\":\"00\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=4 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA0107000807020004000000001C\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"0702000400000000\",\"DpType2Id7\":0,\"7\":{\"DpId\":7,\"DpIdType\":2,\"DpIdData\":\"00000000\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=7 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA0107000808020004000000001D\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"0802000400000000\",\"DpType2Id8\":0,\"8\":{\"DpId\":8,\"DpIdType\":2,\"DpIdData\":\"00000000\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=8 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA0107000809020004000000001E\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"0902000400000000\",\"DpType2Id9\":0,\"9\":{\"DpId\":9,\"DpIdType\":2,\"DpIdData\":\"00000000\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=9 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA010700080A020004000000001F\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"0A02000400000000\",\"DpType2Id10\":0,\"10\":{\"DpId\":10,\"DpIdType\":2,\"DpIdData\":\"00000000\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=10 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA0107000865020004000000007A\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"6502000400000000\",\"DpType2Id101\":0,\"101\":{\"DpId\":101,\"DpIdType\":2,\"DpIdData\":\"00000000\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=101 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA0107000866020004000000007B\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"6602000400000000\",\"DpType2Id102\":0,\"102\":{\"DpId\":102,\"DpIdType\":2,\"DpIdData\":\"00000000\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=102 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA0107000867020004000000007C\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"6702000400000000\",\"DpType2Id103\":0,\"103\":{\"DpId\":103,\"DpIdType\":2,\"DpIdData\":\"00000000\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=103 {\"TuyaReceived\":{\"Data\":\"55AA01070008680200040000099117\",\"Cmnd\":7,\"CmndData\":\"6802000400000991\",\"DpType2Id104\":2449,\"104\":{\"DpId\":104,\"DpIdType\":2,\"DpIdData\":\"00000991\"}}} TYA: fnId=0 is set for dpId=104 Observe all lines printed as TYA: FnId=0 is set for dpId=XXX and note all dpId values.

Since the majority of devices have a power on/off functions on dpId 1 its mapped to fnId 11 (Relay1) by default. If you don't need it, map it to fnId 99 with TuyaMcu 99,1 Danger Mapping a relay or switch to a dpId that is not a simple on/off function (data Type 1) might result in unwanted power toggling (f.e. dpId sends value of 4 which toggles the relay to Power 4 aka blink mode) TuyaSend Command ~ Command TuyaSend is used to send commands to dpId's. It is required for dpId's that shouldn't be mapped to a fnId. With this command it is possible to control every function of the dpId that is controllable, providing you know its data type and data length. With them provided, the rest of the protocol command is calculated. Command's value consists of two comma separated parameters: dpId and data. TuyaSend<x> dpId,data There are 4 different commands, one for each data type . TuyaSend0 Used without payload to query states of dpID's. TuyaSend1 Sends boolean (Type 1) data ( 0/1 ) to dpId (Max data length 1 byte) Example TuyaSend1 1,0 sends vaue 0 to dpId=1 switching the device off TuyaSend2 Sends integer or 4 byte (Type 2) data to dpId (Max data length 4 bytes) Example TuyaSend2 14,100 sends value 100 to dpId=14 setting timer to 100 minutes TuyaSend3 Sends string (Type 3) data to dpId (Max data length? Not known at this time). Warning Note that when sending color values, the MCU may interpret lower case and upper case hex codes differently. You may need to test with your specific MCU to ensure that the values sent properly render the color you desire. Example TuyaSend3 108,ff0000646464ff sends a 14 char hex string to dpId=108 (Type 3) containing RGBHSV values to control a light TuyaSend4 Sends enum (Type 4) data ( 0/1/2/3/4/5 ) to dpId (Max data length 1 bytes) Example TuyaSend4 103,2 sends value 2 to dpId=103 to set fan speed to high TuyaSend8 Used without payload to get device information and dpId states. Replaces SerialSend5 55aa000100000 TuyaSend9 Use without any payload to toggle a STAT topic reporting the equivalent TuyaSend<x> command needed to update a dpId, for example: 17 : 45 : 38 CMD: power 1 17 : 45 : 38 MQT: stat / tasmota_49A3BC / RESULT = { \"POWER\" : \"ON\" } 17 : 45 : 38 MQT: stat / tasmota_49A3BC / POWER = ON 17 : 45 : 38 MQT: stat / tasmota_49A3BC / TUYASEND1 = 1 , 1 TuyaReceived ~ Every status message from the MCU gets a JSON response named TuyaReceived which contains the MCU protocol status message inside key/value pairs which are hidden from the user by default. To publish them to an MQTT Topic of tele/%topic%/RESULT you need to enable SetOption66 1 . Example After issuing serial command 55aa0006000501010001010e (Device power (dpId=1) is mapped to Relay1 (fnId=11)) we get the following console output (with weblog 4 ): 19 : 54 : 18 TYA : Send \"55aa0006000501010001010e\" 19 : 54 : 18 MQT : stat /GD-30W/ STATE = { \"Time\" : \"2019-10-25T19:54:18\" , \"Uptime\" : \"0T01:45:51\" , \"UptimeSec\" : 6351 , \"Heap\" : 27 , \"SleepMode\" : \"Dynamic\" , \"Sleep\" : 0 , \"LoadAvg\" : 999 , \"MqttCount\" : 1 , \"POWER1\" : \"ON\" , \"POWER2\" : \"OFF\" , \"POWER3\" : \"ON\" , \"POWER4\" : \"OFF\" , \"POWER5\" : \"ON\" , \"Dimmer\" : 100 , \"Fade\" : \"OFF\" , \"Speed\" : 1 , \"LedTable\" : \"OFF\" , \"Wifi\" :{ \"AP\" : 1 , \"SSId\" : \"HTPC\" , \"BSSId\" : \"50:64:2B:5B:41:59\" , \"Channel\" : 10 , \"RSSI\" : 24 , \"LinkCount\" : 1 , \"Downtime\" : \"0T00:00:08\" }} 19 : 54 : 18 MQT : stat /GD-30W/ RESULT = { \"POWER1\" : \"ON\" } 19 : 54 : 18 MQT : stat /GD-30W/ POWER1 = ON 19 : 54 : 18 MQT : stat /GD-30W/ RESULT = { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA0007000501010001010F\" , \"ChkSum\" : \"0x0F\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndDataLen\" : 5 , \"CmndData\" : \"0101000101\" , \"DpId\" : 1 , \"DpIdType\" : 1 , \"DpIdLen\" : 1 , \"DpIdData\" : \"01\" }} 19 : 54 : 18 TYA : fnId = 11 is set for dpId = 1 19 : 54 : 18 TYA : RX Relay - 1 --> MCU State : On Current State : On Above TYA: fnId=11 is set for dpId=1 you can see the JSON response for that dpId. This JSON string displays the response MCU gave to our command. \"Data\" field contains the complete response and the rest of the key/value pairs show the protocol broken into parts. \"DpId\", \"DpIdData\" and \"DpIdType\" are the ones we're most interested in since we can use them for TuyaSend . Tip Use command TuyaSend8 and/or TuyaSend0 at any time to request statuses of all dpId's from the MCU. Use in Rules This data can also be used as a trigger for rules using TuyaReceivedData#Data=hex_string Rule1 on TuyaReceived # Data = 55 AA000700056E040001007E do publish2 stat / tuya_light / effect rgb_cycle endon will publish a status message to a custom topic when 55AA000700056E040001007E appears in \"Data\" field of the response. Device Configurations ~ Before proceeding identify dpId's and their function. Dimmer ~ We need to configure four functions of a dimmer: Dimming dpId Dimming Range Dimming less than 10% Dimming dpId The dimmer FunctionId is 21 . On a dimmer dpId generally is 2 or 3 . Try both. Go to the Tasmota Console and type TuyaMCU 21,2 and wait for it to reboot. Enter Backlog Dimmer 10; Dimmer 100 in the Console. If your bulb responds to Dimmer commands, you have successfully configured the dimmer FunctionId. Make note of it. If not try id 3 and if even 3 doesn't work keep trying Ids from all unknown Ids from the log until one works. Dimming Range Once you have figured out the dimming functionId, we need to find the maximum dimming range. Once the dimming Id is set, the logs will continue TYA : Heartbeat TYA : RX Packet : \"55aa03070005010100010011\" TYA : RX Relay - 1 --> MCU State : Off Current State : Off TYA : RX Packet : \"55aa03070008020200040000000720\" TYA : FnId = 21 is set for dpId = 2 TYA : RX Dim State = 7 Now using the hardware buttons increase the dimmer to its maximum and observe the log. The Dim State=XXX shows the current dimmer level reported by MCU. Once the dimmer is at max, note this number. Again using hardware buttons decrease dimmer to minimum and note the number for minimum. Now we need to tell Tasmota to use maximum and minimum values. This controlled by DimmerRange command. We can set it using DimmerRange <Min>,<Max> where <Min> is the minimum dimmer state and <Max> maximum dimmer state reported in logs. Once set, try dimmer 100 in the Console and check if the brightness of bulb is same is the same as when the maximum was set using hardware buttons. Dual Dimmer ~ To enable a dual dimmer setup assign fnId's: 21 as Dimmer1 22 as Dimmer2 11 as Relay1 12 as Relay2 Tasmota will automatically enable SetOption68 and the dimmers will respond to Channel1 and Channel2 commands. Warning The use of SetOption68 is limited to two channels and will be automatically disabled if any other combination of lights is used. Lights ~ CCT Light To enable a CCT light assign fnId's: 21 as Dimmer1 11 as Relay1 23 as CT channel RGB Light To enable an RGB light assign fnId's: 21 as Dimmer1 11 as Relay1 24 as RGB controller RGB+X Light To enable an RGB+W light use RGB Light configuration and assign fnId 25 as white color. To enable an RGB+CCT light use RGB Light configuration and assign fnId 23 as CT channel. Light mode selector The majority of TuyaMCU devices with an RGB+W or an RGB+CCT light have a button or app function to switch between White and Colored light. To do the same in Tasmota, assign function (fnId) 26 to the mode select dpId. The possible values are 0 (white) and 1 (colorful). A button on the WebUI will be available once configured. When the ModeSet function is enabled it is not possible to update both lights at the same time. Only the currently selected light mode will be updated. Warning Use of SetOption68 for more than two channels and the light split option ( SetOption37 >= 128 ) are not supported in TuyaMCU mode. Fans ~ To setup a fan controller select one of the available functions: 61 for 3 speed fan (possible values 0,1,2) 62 for 4 speed fan (possible values 0,1,2,3) 63 for 5 speed fan (possible values 0,1,2,3,4) 64 for 6 speed fan (possible values 0,1,2,3,4,5) Different from other fan controllers like the Ifan03, the value of 0 doesn't mean OFF . In TuyaMCU 0 is the lowest speed possible. On/Off states for a fan are always managed by another dpId which you need to map to a relay function. Covers ~ Single Shutter or double shutters devices can be managed with a dimmer setup For devices that are reporting position to a another dpId assign fnId's: 27 to report the state of Dimmer1 28 to report the state of Dimmer2 If your cover device has a motor direction change option assign fnId 97 for motor direction. Switches ~ There is currenty no way to detect the number of relays present in an MCU based switch. We need to tell the number of relays to Tasmota using FunctionIDs 12 to 18 for Relay2 to Relay4. Example For a 4 gang switch set TuyaMCU 12,2 , TuyaMCU 13,3 and TuyaMCU 14,4 if the dpIds for Relays 2-4 are 2 , 3 , 4 . Tip You can configure all at once by using Backlog TuyaMCU 12,2; TuyaMCU 13,3; TuyaMCU 14,4 Power Metering ~ Some Tuya MCU devices support Power measurement support over serial. For this it is better to use a bulb with known wattage rating.

For example: 00000995 is the second last entry. Make sure the bulb if off. Find out the voltage standard of your country (generally 220, 240, 120v) from this table . Multiply that number by 10 (2400) and Convert that number (2400) to Hex using any hex converter (2400 = 0x960) Now look for the number nearest to 960 in the logs. In our case it is 00000995 . So we expect that's the voltage which is \"DpId\":104 in our example. Set voltage functionId 33 by entering TuyaMCU 33,104 . Now set dimmer to 100% using the dimmer 100 command, or power on using power1 on (depending on the device) and observe the logs. Now we need the power rating of your bulb, for example 40W . Multiply by 10 (400) and convert to hex which gives us 0x190. Check which unknown ID is close to 190 . I this example it is 17E for \"DpId\":103 . This is the Id of Active Power function. Set the active power functionId 31 by entering TuyaMCU 31,103 . Once Power and Voltage are set you should see something such as this in the logs: TYA : Heartbeat { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA0107000501010001000F\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"0101000100\" , \"DpType1Id1\" : 0 , \"1\" :{ \"DpId\" : 1 , \"DpIdType\" : 1 , \"DpIdData\" : \"00\" }}} TYA : fnId = 11 is set for dpId = 1 TYA : RX Relay - 1 --> MCU State : Off Current State : Off { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA01070005020100010111\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"0201000101\" , \"DpType1Id2\" : 1 , \"2\" :{ \"DpId\" : 2 , \"DpIdType\" : 1 , \"DpIdData\" : \"01\" }}} TYA : fnId = 0 is set for dpId = 2 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA01070005030100010011\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"0301000100\" , \"DpType1Id3\" : 0 , \"3\" :{ \"DpId\" : 3 , \"DpIdType\" : 1 , \"DpIdData\" : \"00\" }}} TYA : fnId = 0 is set for dpId = 3 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA01070005040100010113\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"0401000101\" , \"DpType1Id4\" : 1 , \"4\" :{ \"DpId\" : 4 , \"DpIdType\" : 1 , \"DpIdData\" : \"01\" }}} TYA : fnId = 0 is set for dpId = 4 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA0107000807020004000000001C\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"0702000400000000\" , \"DpType2Id7\" : 0 , \"7\" :{ \"DpId\" : 7 , \"DpIdType\" : 2 , \"DpIdData\" : \"00000000\" }}} TYA : fnId = 0 is set for dpId = 7 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA0107000808020004000000001D\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"0802000400000000\" , \"DpType2Id8\" : 0 , \"8\" :{ \"DpId\" : 8 , \"DpIdType\" : 2 , \"DpIdData\" : \"00000000\" }}} TYA : fnId = 0 is set for dpId = 8 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA0107000809020004000000001E\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"0902000400000000\" , \"DpType2Id9\" : 0 , \"9\" :{ \"DpId\" : 9 , \"DpIdType\" : 2 , \"DpIdData\" : \"00000000\" }}} TYA : fnId = 0 is set for dpId = 9 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA010700080A020004000000001F\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"0A02000400000000\" , \"DpType2Id10\" : 0 , \"10\" :{ \"DpId\" : 10 , \"DpIdType\" : 2 , \"DpIdData\" : \"00000000\" }}} TYA : fnId = 0 is set for dpId = 10 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA0107000865020004000000007A\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"6502000400000000\" , \"DpType2Id101\" : 0 , \"101\" :{ \"DpId\" : 101 , \"DpIdType\" : 2 , \"DpIdData\" : \"00000000\" }}} TYA : fnId = 0 is set for dpId = 101 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA01070008660200040000009712\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"6602000400000097\" , \"DpType2Id102\" : 151 , \"102\" :{ \"DpId\" : 102 , \"DpIdType\" : 2 , \"DpIdData\" : \"00000097\" }}} TYA : fnId = 0 is set for dpId = 102 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA01070008670200040000017BF8\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"670200040000017B\" , \"DpType2Id103\" : 379 , \"103\" :{ \"DpId\" : 103 , \"DpIdType\" : 2 , \"DpIdData\" : \"0000017B\" }}} TYA : fnId = 31 is set for dpId = 103 TYA : Rx ID = 103 Active_Power = 379 { \"TuyaReceived\" :{ \"Data\" : \"55AA0107000868020004000009961C\" , \"Cmnd\" : 7 , \"CmndData\" : \"6802000400000996\" , \"DpType2Id104\" : 2454 , \"104\" :{ \"DpId\" : 104 , \"DpIdType\" : 2 , \"DpIdData\" : \"00000996\" }}} TYA : fnId = 33 is set for dpId = 104 TYA : Rx ID = 104 Voltage = 2454 To get the Id for the current, calculate Current = Power / Voltage ( 37.9 / 245.4 ) = ~0.1544 (Remember to divide each value by 10).

They stay the same for each product and are mandatory for Tuya module to work correctly. Functional protocols ~ Functional protocols are used for delivering and reporting data of functions. These protocols differ between devices and manufacturers and might require configuration in Tasmota using TuyaMCU command or with TuyaSend<x> command. Anatomy of Tuya Protocol ~ Name Description Frame Header Version Fixed value of 0x55aa Command Word 0x06 - send commands 0x07 - report status Data Length defines expected length of data dpID numbered ID of a function (DP = Data Point or Define Product) Data Type see Data Type table below Function Length length of command Function Command formatted according to Data Type Verification Method checksum = remainder of the byte sum starting from Frame Header to 256 Data Type Hex Tasmota Command Decription Max length 0x01 TuyaSend1 boolean data 0/1 1 byte 0x02 TuyaSend2 value data. If a value contains less than 4 bytes, 0 is supplemented before 4 bytes 0x00 TuyaSend3 string data unknown 0x04 TuyaSend4 enum data 0/1/2/3/4/5 1 byte 0x05 ### fault data, report only 8 bytes Let's dissect and explain the MCU protocol using serial command 55aa0006000501010001010e : Frame Header Version Command Word Data Length dpID Data Type Function Length Function Command Verification Method 55aa00 06 0005 01 01 0001 01 0e This is the command which powers on the device sending Function Command = 1 to dpID 1 (Switch): Frame Header Version = 0x55aa00 which is a fixed value and always the same Command Word = 0x06 because we're sending a command Data Type = 0x01 since the command sent is a 1 byte boolean Function Length = 0x001 instruct 1 character only for function command length Function Command = 0x01 in hex which equals 1 in int Verification Method = 0e is calculated Protocol flow On device boot, TuyaMCU executes the required basic protocols and reads the functional protocol data received, which are used to update status of components mapped in TuyaMCU (Relays, dimmer, power monitoring data). After receiving a command from Tasmota (Command Word 0x06 ), the MCU performs corresponding logical control. When the dpID status is changed, the MCU reports the data (Command Word 0x07 ) to TuyaMCU component. dpId Function Tables ~ This information is just for orientation. Functions are assigned by the manufacturer and can be on different dpId's DP ID: dpId. Function Point\uff1aUsed to describe the product function. Identifier: Function codename.

Whenever a command is sent to the MCU, this dpId determines which component needs to be controlled and the applies when the status is received from MCU. There is no way to autodetect dpId's and their functions. To assist in the process of determining what dpId does what, there is a bookmarklet available that can be used on the console screen. This will send the weblog and other required commands automatically, and present the TuyaMCU information in a single table allowing for easier testing.

For example: 00000995 is the second last entry. Make sure the bulb if off. Find out the voltage standard of your country (generally 220, 240, 120v) from this table . Multiply that number by 10 (2400) and Convert that number (2400) to Hex using any hex converter (2400 = 0x960) Now look for the number nearest to 960 in the logs. In our case it is 00000995 . So we expect that's the voltage which is \"DpId\":104 in our example. Set voltage functionId 33 by entering TuyaMCU 33,104 . Now set dimmer to 100% using the dimmer 100 command, or power on using power1 on (depending on the device) and observe the logs. Now we need the power rating of your bulb, for example 40W . Multiply by 10 (400) and convert to hex which gives us 0x190. Check which unknown ID is close to 190 . I this example it is 17E for \"DpId\":103 . This is the Id of Active Power function. Set the active power functionId 31 by entering TuyaMCU 31,103 .

In other words, ensure that there is a good reason to mess with a working installation (e.g., a need to use a new feature or address a found problem fixed in the current version). Backup before upgrading Any time you upgrade it is highly recommended to back up your device settings . That is easily done from the webUI using Configuration - Backup Config . If you wish to switch to a different build or use development branch you need to download a binary file (gzipped or regular) or change the OTA Url link. Download binaries from: GitHub releases official OTA Server development branch OTA Server your personal OTA server Gzipped binaries ~ Gzipped binaries can be used only once you've upgraded to atleast Tasmota 8.2 Trying to upgrade with a gzipped binary using versions older than 8.2 will fail. Tasmota 8.2 introduced upgrading using gzipped binaries which are smaller in size and will likely skip the intermediary minimal build installation. This makes the upgrade process faster and straightforward. To use simply add .gz to the existing OTA Url or download the .bin.gz binary from the official OTA Server and the next upgrade will use the compressed file. Upgrade using webUI ~ Upgrading the device firmware over-the-air , aka OTA, is the most convenient way to upgrade. To start the upgrade, open a web browser to your device's web UI and select Firmware Upgrade . You are presented with two choices: Upgrade by webserver - use an OTA server Ugprade by file upload - uploading a downloaded or self-compiled binary file from your computer Upgrade by web server ~ If you want to upgrade to the latest release version click the first Start Upgrade button. This screen should appear During this process Tasmota will download the new firmware from the url and install it. If you're not using a gzipped binary it might need to download tasmota-minimal.bin first, but all that happens automatically. All you have to do is wait 2 to 5 minutes . After the upgrade is completed you can reconnect back to the web UI and check the firmware version on the bottom of the page or in the Information tab of the webUI. Upgrade by file upload ~ Go to Firmware Upgrade . This time browse to the binary you want to upgrade to with Choose File and click Start upgrade . In our example its tasmota-sensors.bin . You will see an Upload starting... and then Upload successful message. Wait until the device restarts, reconnect back to the web UI and check the firmware version on the bottom of the page or in the Information tab of the webUI. Minimal build upgrade step If the binary you're upgrading with is larger than 500kb you also need to download the minimal build ( tasmota-minimal.bin(.gz) ) since the upload process needs the space in flash memory to upload the new binary. When you try to immediately upgrade with the new binary without using smaller minimal firmware you will be greeted with this error. Minimal build upgrade step This step is necessary only if you get the above error Browse to the minimal binary with Choose File . The chosen filename should be visible. In our example its tasmota-minimal.bin . Wait until the device restarts. In the Main Menu web UI will display this warning message on top. Proceed to upgrade Using Commands ~ Your device can be upgraded using commands via MQTT, web requests or Console in the web UI. OtaUrl is used to set your OTA address. OtaUrl http :// ota . tasmota . com / tasmota / tasmota - sensors . bin In this example we chose a development branch version with additional sensors support Initiate upgrade from OTA server Upgrade 1 Wait for the upgrade process to complete and check the Tasmota version. In console you can use Status 2 . Using Device Button ~ Devices with a built in button (the one used to put your device into flash mode ) can initiate OTA upgrade with it. 7 short presses of the button will start OTA download of firmware using the Ota Url. Device LED is lit during the update. Serial Upgrade ~ Upgrade over the serial connection using serial-to-USB adapter. Upload the new version over serial using the same process as in Flashing but DO NOT erase flash. The new binary will overwrite the old one and keep your settings. External Programs ~ Tasmota Device Manager or TDM is a multiplatform GUI application written in Python for discovery and management of Tasmota devices. You can set up OTA url and initiate OTA upgrade from TDM using GUI. openHAB - implement an automation rule to upgrade devices from openHAB Node-RED OTA server and firmware manager - Node-RED flow for managing OTA updates OTA over SCP - setup and configure \"OTA over SCP\" upload for PlatformIO Private OTA Server ~ It is possible to create your own simple http OTA server (https is not supported) using Python and perform upgrades from there. Install Python3 and from the folder where the binary resides (make sure tasmota-minimal.bin is located there too) run: python -m http.server 8000 (If the response is \"No module named http\" then try again with python3 instead of python .) Change your OtaUrl to http://ipoftheserver:8000/yourbinary.bin(.gz) and start the upgrade process. Note: do not use / , - , or . characters in the name of yourbinary . If your binary build (yourbinary.bin) is larger than the available free flash program space, Tasmota will need to first install the minimal version of Tasmota to make more space. To have this work via the web server OTA process, you have to copy the file tasmota-minimal.bin in the same folder where OTAURL for yourbinary.bin is placed, and rename tasmota-minimal.bin to yourbinary-minimal.bin . Migration Path ~ Until now several versions of Tasmota have been released starting with the C version Sonoff-MQTT-OTA followed by Sonoff-MQTT-OTA-Arduino, Sonoff-Tasmota and ultimately Tasmota. Intermediate upgrade steps are needed to migrate from older firmware to the current version. No migration is possible from original Sonoff-MQTT-OTA to Sonoff-MQTT-OTA-Arduino v1.0.11. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO UPGRADE VERSIONS PRIOR TO v7.x STRAIGHT TO THE CURRENT VERSION Remember that you must take each individual step between the device firmware version and the latest available.You can find all the required binaries in Tasmota Releases listed by version number. Tip As a safeguard perform \"Backup Configuration\" before upgrading. If settings are lost \"Restore Configuration\" should bring them back. Upgrading from one minor version to the next is mostly painless as the settings are saved in the same location in flash and newer settings are appended. As said, mostly painless! There are some deviations to this rule as the flash settings changed. Upgrade Flow ~ v1.0.11 v3.9.22 v4.2.0 v5.14.0 v6.1.1 v7.2.0 v8.1.0 Current release Follow the path strictly to ensure success. Do not install only tasmota-minimal.bin but upgrade to full, working firmware. Linked -lite/-classic.bin binaries will do the job. Tasmota v8.1 introduced a major change in parameter storage. Downgrading is not recommended and upgrading to 8.1 has to follow the recommended path and can still fail in some cases. Don't forget to backup! Notice for versions between 6.6.0.7 and 6.6.0.11 If you've used development versions between 6.6.0.7 and 6.6.0.11 back up your device settings . Convert the backup to human readable form as you MUST restore these settings manually. Perform a Reset 6 before upgrading the firmware and, for safe measure, after the upgrade completes. Downgrading ~ While fallback or downgrading is common practice it was never supported due to Settings additions or changes in newer releases. Starting with release v8.1.0 Doris settings in flash are re-allocated in such a way that fallback is only allowed and possible to v7.2.0. Once at v7.2.0 you're on your own when downgrading even further. Backing Up Settings ~ Tasmota uses flash memory to store options and settings. New versions add (or remove) features that use various regions of that memory. If you did not erase flash when you flashed your device, an updated version of Tasmota may be accessing areas with values left over from the old Tasmota or even the original factory firmware. This might cause unexpected and unwanted behavior or even major problems (constant reboots or reconnects). To avoid this use our decode-config tool to easily create and restore backups in Tasmota: decode-config tool ~ decode-config - OS independent Python program to backup and restore Tasmota configuration data, also available as precompiled executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux. See Using instructions for details. If using one of the precompiled binary for your OS replace decode-config.py with decode-config_win32.exe , decode-config_win64.exe , decode-config_mac or decode-config_linux from the instruction examples. 1. make a configuration backup: Create a new backup straight from your device decode-config.py --source <deviceIP> --backup-file Config-@f @f will be replaced by decode-config to device's FriendlyName or Create a backup from previously made .dmp file decode-config.py --source <dmp_filename> --backup-file Config-@f 2. perform a device reset Erase flash settings area but keep Wi-Fi and MQTT settings Reset 6 3. upgrade the firmware via OTA or file upload 4. restore configuration decode-config.py --source <deviceIP> --restore-file <backupfile> ...and you're done! If you can't restore configuration directly you can configure the device manually referring to the Commands article and the settings (e.g., SetOptions, Rules, etc.) in the JSON file you created in step #1. You can paste the JSON into a JSON parser to make it easily readable. Tip If Backup Configuration -> Restore Configuration fails, reset to firmware defaults and use decode-config tool to restore your backed up configuration.","title":"Upgrading"},{"location":"Upgrading/#gzipped-binaries","text":"Gzipped binaries can be used only once you've upgraded to atleast Tasmota 8.2 Trying to upgrade with a gzipped binary using versions older than 8.2 will fail.

If you are using a Wemos D1 Mini or NodeMCU, just plug the microUSB port. Vcc (3.3V), GND, Tx (GPIO1), and Rx (GPIO3) are connected via the microUSB port. Be sure that you are using a USB data cable. For ESP devices that do not have a microUSB connector, make the following connections: ESP Device Serial Programming Adapter Vcc Vcc GND GND GPIO0 GND GPIO1 Rx GPIO3 Tx Follow the usual ESP82xx flashing process - you are just using CCLib_proxy.ino.bin instead of Tasmota.

CC2530 Serial protocol ~ The CC2530 is flashed with Texas Instrument ZNP Software version 1.2. The protocol is build on a serial communication between the main cpu and the CC2530. Z-Stack 1.2 Monitor and Test API Serial communication is configured as 8N1, 115200 bauds. We suggest to use GPIO13/15 because they have hardware serial support. Please note that there is only one usable hardware serial, either on GPIO1/3 or GPIO13/15. To enable hardware serial on GPIO13/15 for Tasmota, set Serial 0 and restart. Otherwise Z2T will use Software serial provided by TasmotaSerial. Receiving 115200 bauds in software is a timing challenge. Here is the anatomy of a byte transmitted in serial mode. Each bit is 8.7\u00b5s, or ~700 CPU cycles at 80MHz (1400 cycles at 160MHz). It all starts with a LOW \"start bit\" that generates an interrupt transferred to TasmotaSerial. Then TasmotaSerial enters a tightly controlled loop to read each bit (least sifnificant first). The frame stops with a HIGH stop bit. What can go wrong? Tasmota may be already handling an interrupt when the start bit arrives, potentially causing a shift by 1 bit and a wrong message. Here is a 0xFE byte correctly received: Same frame with a delay in the interrupt handler, and mistakenly read 0xFF: TasmotaSerial has been improved to allow receiving a train of bytes withtout any disruption. CC2530 generally sends all the bytes one after the other for a single ZNP message (up to 250 bytes). Instead of giving back control after the first byte, the TasmotaSerial interrupt handler continues to monitor the serial RX line for the next 4 bits and checks whether a new start bit arrived. It avoids any error after the first byte was received. Still the first byte in the message could have been wrong. Fortunately, the first byte sent by ZNP is always 0xFE (see below). This means that if the interrupt arrives too late, Tasmota will read 0xFF instead of 0xFE. Z2T software does automatic error correction in this case, i.e. if the first byte received is 0xFF, it is automatically assumed to be 0xFE and the rest of the message is read normally. With these two schemes, software serial for Zigbee proved to be extremely reliable, even at 80MHz. It is highly recommended though to run at 160MHz. State machine - CC2530 initialization and configuration ~ After Tasmota boots, it sends the sequence 410001 to force a CC2530 hardware reset. Z2T implements an asynchronous state machine to handle the initialization and configuration of the CC2530. The state machine sends commands and waits for responses (with time-outs) and takes different branches depending on the responses. Instruction set ~ The program is encoded as a list of 32 bits instructions, stored in Flash in the zb_prog array of type Zigbee_Instruction[] . There is a PC (program counter) that is increased at each tick (i.e. every 50ms). The state machine has very simple instructions. Instructions encoded with 4 bytes: NOOP : no-operation, do nothing and move to the next instruction LABEL(x) : no-operation, and defines a Label (8 bits) that can be called by code. GOTO(x) : moves the PC to the instruction with LABEL(x) ZI_ON_ERROR_GOTO(x) : if an error occurs, move to label ZI_ON_TIMEOUT_GOTO(x) : if a timeout occurs, move to lavel WAIT(y) : wait for milliseconds (unsigned 16 bits). Note the granularity is 50ms and the wait is non-blocking WAIT_FOREVER : pause the state machine and wait for an external goto STOP : stop completely the state machine, only used after an unrecoverable error Instructions encoded with 8 bytes: CALL(f, x) : call a function, is the address of the function of type uint32_t f(uint8_t) . The input parameter is . The response is according to callbacks responses, except -1 (time-out) simply continues the flow. LOG(m) : log the string . can be in PROGMEM. For debugging only. MQTT_STATE(x, m) : sends a MQTT ZbState message, with status code and message . can be in PROGMEM. SEND(d) : send a ZNP sequence to CC2530. is an array of , a macro computes automatically the size of the array. can be in PROGMEM. WAIT_RECV(x, m) : wait for a specific message to be received with a time-out of (uint16_t). Messages take into account are owly those matching the first 2 bytes. The complete message match is expected or an error is generated. If the message received is longer than , additional bytes are ignored WAIT_UNTIL(x, m) : similar to WAIT_RECV but message that don't match are ignored, until a matching message is received. ON_RECV_UNEXPECTED(f) : if we received an unexpected (or unsupported) zigbee message, call function Instructions encoded with 12 bytes: WAIT_RECV_FUNC(x, m, f) : similar to WAIT_RECV and a function is called when the message matches. All callbacks return int32_t with the following effect: > 0 : goto the corresponding label 0 : continue -1 : signal a time-out < -1 : trigger an error (goto on_error) Initialization code for the state machine ~ At Tasmota start-up, the state-machine fires. The current Z2T pseudo-code does the following: Init: Set-up all the error handling functions Wait for 10.5 seconds after boot Send a RESET to CC2530 Wait for CC2530 boot Check configuration (if something is wrong, go to CONFIGURE): Check if the CC2530 was previously configured. It uses the same 1-byte Non-Volatile 0xF00 address and stores 0x55. Checks the Z-Stack version Checks the internal configuration: PanID, Ext PanID, Channel, PFGK and PFGKEN. If all good, emit an MQTT message saying Zigbee is configured Goto Start Configure (only if needed): Emit an MQTT message for reconfiguration Do a factory reset of CC2530 Reset the device once again Configure the following: PanId, Ext PanId, Channel, set type to Coordinator, PFKEY, PFKEYEN, Security Module Create NF 0xF00 location and store 0x55 Goto Start Start: Wait for CC2530 message saying the coordinator sucessfully started Query DeviceInfo Query Node Descriptor Query Active Endpoints Register 2 endpoints with profile 0x0104 (Home Automation) : 0x01 (default), 0x0B (for Xiaomi) Query Active Endpoints to verify 0x01 and 0x0B are active Close PermitJoin: don't accept any pairing Emit an MQTT message to indicate Zigbee started Mark Zigbee as initialized, accept incoming messages Load device configuration from Flash Query any lights declared with ZbLight to read their current states Pause the state machine Pairing devices ~ When you open pairing with ZbPermitJoin 1 (60 seconds) or ZbPermitJoin 99 (until next reboot), you allow new devices to join the network. Example below is for an OSRAM Plug.

Hence it is easier to deploy wherever you want in your home. It is largely inspired by Zigbee2mqtt but it's a complete rewrite to make it fit on an ESP82xx with 80kB of RAM and only 1MB of flash memory. Hardware ~ This integration works with Sonoff ZbBridge and any Texas Instruments CC2530x chip based device. A complete list of compatible coordinators and Zigbee devices compatible with Z2T is in the Zigbee Device Compatibility Repository . While initially designed for CC253x (Z-Stack firmware), the appearance of Sonoff ZbBridge required using a different protocol (EZSP). Once the coordinator is started and communicates with Tasmota, the end result is the same and there is no difference in their operation. Flashing and installation instructions for: Sonoff ZbBridge CC2530x based devices Introduction ~ Before using Zigbee with Tasmota, you need to understand a few concepts. Here is a simplified comparison to the Wi-Fi equivalent (sort of). Zigbee concept Wi-Fi equivalent Zigbee coordinator The coordinator is responsible for selecting the channel, PanID, security policy, and stack profile for a network. Zigbee2Tasmota will act as a coordinator. You can have multiple coordinators as long as they have different PanIDs. Wi-Fi Access Point PanID (Personal Area Network IDentifier) This parameter is unique in a Zigbee network (16-bit integer, 0x0000\u20130x3FFF). Default: 0x1A63 SSID (the Wi-Fi network name) ShortAddr Address of the device on the Zigbee network. This address is randomly assigned when the device first connects to the coordinator (16 bits integer, 0x0000\u20130xFFF7). The coordinator has address 0x0000. You need to track which device has which address or assign a \"Friendly Name\" to each new discovered device. IP address GroupAddr Group address of a collection of devices, it allows a single message to address multiple devices at once (16 bits integer, 0x0000\u20130xFFFF). For example a remote can turn on/off a group of lights. GroupAddr 0x0000 is not assigned. Multicast Endpoint The endpoint on the coordinator or on the Zigbee device the message is sent from/to. You can see endpoints as logical device providing distinct features (8 bits integer, 1\u2013240). IP Port IEEEAddr Device hardware address (64 bits). This is unique per device and factory assigned. MAC address Channel 11-26 Default: 11 (See Zigbee-Wifi coexistence ) Wi-Fi Channel Encryption Key 128-bit encryption key. default: 0x0D0C0A08060402000F0D0B0907050301 Wi-Fi password Pairing By default the coordinator does not accept new devices unless put in pairing mode. When in pairing mode, it will accept pairing requests from any device within range. Default: pairing disabled WPS Cluster Clusters are a group of commands and attributes that define what a device can do. Think of clusters as a group of actions by function. A device can support multiple clusters to do a whole variety of tasks. The majority of clusters are defined by the ZigBee Alliance and listed in the ZigBee Cluster Library Usage ~ For a list of available commands see Zigbee Commands . Pairing Devices ~ When you create a new Zigbee network, it contains no devices except the coordinator. The first step is to add devices to the network, which is called pairing . By default, and for security reasons, the Zigbee coordinator does not automatically accept new devices. To pair new devices, use ZbPermitJoin 1 . Once Zigbee2Tasmota is in pairing mode, put the Zigbee device into pairing mode. This is usually accomplished by pressing the button on the device for 5 seconds or more. To stop pairing, use ZbPermitJoin 0 . ZbPermitJoin 1 CMD: ZbPermitJoin 1 MQT: stat/%topic%/RESULT = { \"ZbPermitJoin\" : \"Done\" } MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = { \"ZbState\" :{ \"Status\" : 21 , \"Message\" : \"Enable Pairing mode for 60 seconds\" }} 60 seconds later: MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = { \"ZbState\" :{ \"Status\" : 20 , \"Message\" : \"Disable Pairing mode\" }} ZbPermitJoin 0 MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = { \"ZbState\" :{ \"Status\" : 20 , \"Message\" : \"Disable Pairing mode\" }} Info Although this is highly discouraged, you can permanently enable Zigbee pairing, until the next reboot, with ZbPermitJoin 99 . After the device has successfully paired it will be shown in the webui with its short address and its link quality number (LQI). When it is a battery powered device, the battery percentage will be displayed as soon as it is received from the device. Devices will show friendly name once you set it. Setting Friendly Name ~ Instead of a short address like 0x8F20 you can assign a, memorable, friendly name such as \"Bedroom_Sensor\" . See ZbName command for all options. Xiaomi Aqara Cube with address 0x128F MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = { \"ZbReceived\" :{ \"0x128F\" :{ \"AqaraVibrationMode\" : \"tilt\" , \"AqaraVibrationsOrAngle\" : 162 , \"AqaraAccelerometer\" :[ -690 , 2 , 138 ], \"AqaraAngles\" :[ -78 , 0 , 11 ], \"LinkQuality\" : 158 }}} Setting its friendly name to Vibration_sensor : ZbName 0 x 128 F,Vibration_sensor CMD: ZbName 0 x 128 F,Vibration_sensor MQT: stat/%topic%/RESULT = { \"0x128F\" :{ \"Name\" : \"Vibration_sensor\" }} ( 10 seconds later) ZIG: Zigbee Devices Data store in Flash ( 0 x 402 FF 800 - 270 bytes) Now the sensor readings includes the friendly name: MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = { \"ZbReceived\" :{ \"0x128F\" :{ \"Name\" : \"Vibration_sensor\" , \"AqaraVibrationMode\" : \"tilt\" , \"AqaraVibrationsOrAngle\" : 171 , \"AqaraAccelerometer\" :[ -691 , 12 , 130 ], \"AqaraAngles\" :[ -78 , 1 , 11 ], \"LinkQuality\" : 153 }}} If you set SetOption83 1 sensor readings will use the friendly name as KSON key, short address is added as Device : MQT: tele/%topic%/RESULT = { \"ZbReceived\" :{ \"Vibration_sensor\" :{ \"Device\" : \"0x128F\" , \"AqaraVibrationMode\" : \"tilt\" , \"AqaraVibrationsOrAngle\" : 171 , \"AqaraAccelerometer\" :[ -691 , 8 , 136 ], \"AqaraAngles\" :[ -78 , 1 , 11 ], \"LinkQuality\" : 153 }}} Removing Devices ~ To remove a device from Zigbee2Tasmota use command ZbForget <device> or ZbForget <friendlyname> . Pairing Example ~ This is an example of a pairing process for the Aqara Temperature & Humidity Sensor . To pair this sensor, issue ZbPermitJoin 1 and then press and hold the reset button for 5 seconds. The sensor LED will flash several times and you will see log entries in the console, especially this one: MQT : tele /%topic%/ SENSOR = { \"ZbState\" :{ \"Status\" : 30 , \"IEEEAddr\" : \"0x00158D00036B50AE\" , \"ShortAddr\" : \"0x8F20\" , \"PowerSource\" : false , \"ReceiveWhenIdle\" : false , \"Security\" : false }} Message with \"Status\":30 shows some characteristics of the device: Field name Value Status 30 indicates a device connect or reconnect.

Commands should be sent when the device reconnects and is idle Security Security capability (meaning unknown, to be determined) Reading Sensors ~ Most sensors will publish their readings regularly or once a significant change has happened: temperature, pressure, humidity, presence, illuminance... Sensor messages are published via MQTT when they are received from the Zigbee device. Similar to Zigbee2MQTT, Z2T tries to group and debounce sensor values when they are received within a 300ms window. Aqara Temperature & Humidity Sensor This sensor monitors humidity, temperature, and air pressure. Its Zigbee model ID is lumi.weather . This device publishes sensor values roughly every hour or when a change occurs. You can also force an update pressing the device's button. It sends two kinds of messages, either 3x standard Zigbee messages, or a single proprietary message containing all sensor values. 0x8F20 is the ShortAddress of the sensor, and its name is Kitchen if you used ZbName 0x8F20,Kithchen . MQT: tele/%topic%/SENSOR = { \"ZbReceived\" : { \"0x8F20\" : { \"Name\" : \"Kitchen\" , \"Voltage\" : 2.995 , \"Battery\" : 98 , \"Temperature\" : 21.01 , \"Humidity\" : 53.68 , \"Pressure\" : 1004.04 , \"PressureUnit\" : \"hPa\" , \"Endpoint\" : 1 , \"LinkQuality\" : 88 }} or prefixed by name if you set SetOption83 1 MQT: tele/%topic%/SENSOR = { \"ZbReceived\" : { \"Kitchen\" : { \"Device\" : \"0x8F20\" , \"Voltage\" : 2.995 , \"Battery\" : 98 , \"Temperature\" : 21.01 , \"Humidity\" : 53.68 , \"Pressure\" : 1004.04 , \"PressureUnit\" : \"hPa\" , \"Endpoint\" : 1 , \"LinkQuality\" : 88 }} Topic is device specific, to allow more effective retained messages, if you set SetOption89 1 MQT: tele/%topic%/ 8 F 20 /SENSOR = { \"ZbReceived\" : { \"Kitchen\" : { \"Device\" : \"0x8F20\" , \"Voltage\" : 2.995 , \"Battery\" : 98 , \"Temperature\" : 21.01 , \"Humidity\" : 53.68 , \"Pressure\" : 1004.04 , \"PressureUnit\" : \"hPa\" , \"Endpoint\" : 1 , \"LinkQuality\" : 88 }} Supported values: Field name Value LinkQuality Stength of the Zigbee signal, between 1 and 254 (integer).

If a value is not decoded, it will appear as \"<cluster>_<attr>\":<value> where <cluster> is the Zigbee ZCL Cluster of the attribute (family), <attr> is the attribute number and <value> its published value. Example \"0402_0000\":2240 is attribute 0x0000 from cluster 0x0402, which is the temperature in hundredth of \u00b0C. It is automatically converted to \"Temperature\":22.40 . Device Information ~ You can dump the internal information gathered about connected Zigbee devices with the command ZbStatus . You can use ZbStatus2 to display all information and endpoints. If probing was successful (at pairing time or using ZbProbe ), Tasmota will automatically find the right endpoint. Depending on the number of devices you have, ZbStatus2 output can exceed the maximum MQTT message size. You can request the status of each individual device using ZbStatus2 1 , ZbStatus2 2 , ZbStatus2 3 or ZbStatus2 <friendly_name> ZbStatus1 - List all connected devices { \"ZbStatus1\" :[{ \"Device\" : \"0x6B58\" },{ \"Device\" : \"0xE9C3\" },{ \"Device\" : \"0x3D82\" }]} ZbStatus2 - Display detailed information for each device, including long address, model and manufacturer ID: { \"ZbStatus2\" :[{ \"Device\" : \"0x4773\" , \"IEEEAddr\" : \"0x7CB03EAA0A0292DD\" , \"ModelId\" : \"Plug 01\" , \"Manufacturer\" : \"OSRAM\" , \"Endpoints\" :[ \"0x03\" ]},{ \"Device\" : \"0x135D\" , \"Name\" : \"Temp_sensor\" , \"IEEEAddr\" : \"0x00158D00036B50AE\" , \"ModelId\" : \"lumi.weather\" , \"Manufacturer\" : \"LUMI\" , \"Endpoints\" :[ \"0x01\" ]}]} (formatted for readability) { \"ZbStatus2\" : [{ \"Device\" : \"0x4773\" , \"IEEEAddr\" : \"0x7CB03EAA0A0292DD\" , \"ModelId\" : \"Plug 01\" , \"Manufacturer\" : \"OSRAM\" , \"Endpoints\" : [ \"0x03\" ] }, { \"Device\" : \"0x135D\" , \"Name\" : \"Temp_sensor\" , \"IEEEAddr\" : \"0x00158D00036B50AE\" , \"ModelId\" : \"lumi.weather\" , \"Manufacturer\" : \"LUMI\" , \"Endpoints\" : [ \"0x01\" ] }] } ZbStatus3 - Display detailed information for each device, including long address, model and manufacturer ID and a list of endpoints and clusters Understanding Endpoints and Clusters ~ An endpoint supports different functions separated in clusters and a device can have multiple endpoints to do different things. To simplify, think of your Zigbee device as a normal Tasmota device with a Zigbee radio instead of Wi-Fi. Each endpoint is akin to a GPIO that has connected Components or Clusters, in Zigbee terms. Cluster definitions in relation to their endpoint are determined by Zigbee Alliance . Not all manufacturers followed the proposed allocations but in general it is a cornerstone document. Z2T will automatically take the first endpoint in the list which works most of the time. You normally don't need to specify the endpoint number. In rare cases, you can force a specific endpoint. Sending Device Commands ~ You can send commands to a device or groups of devices similar to a normal Tasmota command. For example to turn on a light or switch off a plug. Here is a list of supported commands, see below how to send any unlisted command. Command Parameters Cluster number Power 1 or true or \"true\" or \"on\" : On 0 or false or \"false\" or \"off\" : Off 2 or \"toggle\" : Toggle 0x0006 Dimmer 0..254 : Dimmer value 255 is normally considered as invalid, and may be converted to 254 0x0008 DimmerUp : no parameter. Increases dimmer by 10% 0x0008 DimmerDown : no parameter. Decreases dimmer by 10% 0x0008 DimmerStop : no parameter. Stops any running increase of decrease of dimmer. 0x0008 ResetAlarm <alarmcode>,<clusterid> : (to be documented later) 0x0009 ResetAllAlarms : no parameter, (to be documented later) 0x0009 Hue 0..254 : change Hue value 0x0300 Sat 0..254 : change Sat value 0x0300 HueSat 0..254,0..254 : change both Hue and Sat values 0x0300 Color 0..65534,0..65534 : change the color using [x,y] coordinates 0x0300 CT 0..65534 : change the white color-temperature in mireds 0x0300 Shutter 0..254 : send any Shutter command (prefer the commands below) 0x0102 ShutterOpen : no parameter, open shutter 0x0102 ShutterClose : no parameter, close shutter 0x0102 ShutterStop : no parameter, stop shutter movement 0x0102 ShutterLift 0..100 : move shutter to a specific position in percent 0 %=open, 100 %=closed 0x0102 ShutterTilt 0..100 : move the shutter to the specific tilt position in percent 0x0102 The format of the command is following: ZbSend {\"Device\":\"<device>\",\"Send\":{\"<sendcmd>\":<sendparam>}} where <device> identifies the target and can be a shortaddr 0x1234 , a longaddr 0x1234567812345678 or a friendly name Kitchen . \u2003 \"<sendcmd>\":<sendparam> is the command and its parameters from the table. If the device has been correctly paired and its endpoints recorded by Z2T, you shouldn't need to specify a target endpoint. You can use an option \"endpoint\":<endpoint> parameter if Z2T can't find the correct endpoint or if you want to change from the default endpoint. Low-level Commands ~ There is a special syntax if you want to send arbitrary commands: \"Send\":\"<send_bytes>\" where <send_bytes> has the following syntax: \"<cluster>_<cmd>/<bytes>\" : send a non-cluster specific command for cluster id <cluster> , command id <cmd> and payload <bytes> . Example ZbSend {\"Device\":\"0x1234\",\"Send\":\"0000_00/0500\"} Send a Read command (0x00) to the general cluster (0x0000) for attribute ManufId (0x0005). Note: all values are little-endian. Or use '!' instead of '_' to specify cluster-specific commands: \"<cluster>!<cmd>/<bytes>\" : send a cluster specific command for cluster id <cluster> , command id <cmd> and payload <bytes> . Example ZbSend {\"Device\":\"0x1234\",\"Send\":\"0008_04/800A00\"} Send a Dimmer command (0x04) from Level Control cluster (0x0008) with payload being: Dimmer value 0x80, and transition time of 1 second (0x000A = 10 tenths of seconds). Of course the latter example could be simply: ZbSend {\"Device\":\"0x1234\",\"Send\":{\"Dimmer\":\"0x80\"} Examples ~ Plug ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x4773\" , \"send\" :{ \"Power\" : \"On\" } } ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x4773\" , \"send\" :{ \"Power\" : 1 } } ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x4773\" , \"send\" :{ \"Power\" : false } } ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x4773\" , \"send\" :{ \"Power\" : \"Toggle\" } } Read the On/Off status: (all three commands below are synonyms) ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x4773\" , \"endpoint\" : \"0x03\" , \"cluster\" : \"0x0006\" , \"read\" : \"0x0000\" } ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x4773\" , \"endpoint\" : \"0x03\" , \"cluster\" : \"0x0006\" , \"read\" :[ \"0x0000\" ] } ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x4773\" , \"endpoint\" : 3 , \"cluster\" : 6 , \"read\" : 0 } MQT: tele/tasmota/SENSOR = { \"ZbReceived\" :{ \"0x4773\" :{ \"Power\" : true , \"LinkQuality\" : 52 }}} Bulb ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x3D82\" , \"send\" :{ \"Power\" : \"Off\" } } ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x3D82\" , \"send\" :{ \"Dimmer\" : 128 } } ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x3D82\" , \"send\" :{ \"Dimmer\" : 254 } } ZbSend { \"device\" : \"0x3D82\" , \"endpoint\" : \"0x0B\" , \"send\" :{ \"Dimmer\" : 0 } } Receiving Commands ~ If you pair devices such as switches or remotes, you will also receive commands from those devices. When a command is received, attributes are published both in their low-level and high-level formats (if known). Low level format is the following: \"<cluster>!<cmd>\":\"<payload\" IKEA On/Off Switch {\"ZbReceived\":{\"0x3476\":{\"Device\":\"0x3476\",\"Name\":\"ikea_switch\",\"0006!01\":\"\",\"Power\":1,\"Endpoint\":1,\"LinkQuality\":134}}} The command received \"0006!01\":\"\" is Power On (0x01) from On/Off cluster (0x0006) with no payload. It is also translated as \"Power\":1 . \"Endpoint\":1 tells you from which endpoint the command was sent. Light State Tracking Once Z2T receives a command related to a light (Power, Dimmer, Color, ColorTemp), it sends right after a Read command to get the actual state of the light. This is used for Hue Emulation and Alexa support. The final attributes are read betwenn 200ms and 1000ms later, to allow for the light to achieve its target state.

For example, you can set a remote to control directly a group of lights, without any rules on the coordinator. The coordinator will still receive all commands. Example of direct binding ZbBind {\"Device\":\"0xC2EF\",\"ToDevice\":\"0x5ADF\",\"Endpoint\":1,\"ToEndpoint\":1,\"Cluster\":6} This command links the device 0xC2EF that will send all commands for cluster 6 (On/off cluster) frome endpoint 1 to the target device 0x5ADF on endpoint 1 . Example of group binding ZbBind {\"Device\":\"0xC2EF\",\"ToGroup\":100,\"Endpoint\":1,\"Cluster\":6} This command links the device 0xC2EF that will send all commands for cluster 6 (On/off clustre) and from endpoint 1 to the group 100 . Reponse in case of success MQT : tele /%topic%/ RESULT = { \"ZbBind\" :{ \"Device\" : \"0xF72F\" , \"Name\" : \"IKEA_Remote\" , \"Status\" : 0 , \"StatusMessage\" : \"SUCCESS\" }} Example: IKEA remote and IKEA Light IKEA remotes only support 1 group and can be linked to a light only via group numbers (no direct binding). Add the light to group 100 ZbSend {\"device\":\"IKEA_Light\",\"Send\":{\"AddGroup\":100}} Bind the remote to group 100. Note: you need to press a button on the remote right before sending this command to make sure it's not in sleep mode ZbBind {\"Device\":\"IKEA_Remote\",\"ToGroup\":100,\"Endpoint\":1,\"Cluster\":6} Zigbee Groups ~ Zigbee has a unique feature call Groups. It allows you to send a single command to a group of devices. For example: a remote can control a group of multiple lights when grouped. Zigbee groups are 16 bits arbitrary numbers that you can freely assign. When you send to a group, you don't specify a target address anymore, nor an endpoint. Groups works in two steps: first you add devices to groups, second you send commands to groups. See Zigbee Binding on how to configure a remote to send commands to a specific group. Configuring groups for devices requires to send commands. Make sure the device is powered and awake (wake-up battery powered devices). List all groups for a device ZbSend {\"device\":\"IKEA_Light\",\"Send\":{\"GetAllGroups\":true}} MQT : tele /%topic%/ SENSOR = { \"ZbReceived\" :{ \"IKEA_Light\" :{ \"Device\" : \"0x5ADF\" , \"0004<02\" : \"FF00\" , \"GetGroupCapacity\" : 255 , \"GetGroupCount\" : 0 , \"GetGroup\" :[], \"Endpoint\" : 1 , \"LinkQuality\" : 80 }}} The following response tells you: \"GetGroupCount\":1 the light belongs to one group \"GetGroup\":[100] and the group number is 100 .

Example: power on all light in group 100: ZbSend {\"group\":100,\"Send\":{\"Power\":1}} set all dimmers in group 100 to 50%: ZbSend {\"group\":100,\"Send\":{\"Dimmer\":127}} Zigbee and Hue Emulation for Alexa ~ Z2T now supports Hue Emulation for Zigbee lights. It will mimic most of Zigbee gateways, and allows you to control Zigbee lights directly with Alexa, without any MQTT broker nor Alexa skill. Command ZbLight configures a Zigbee device to be Alexa controllable. Specify the number of channels the light supports: 0 Simple On/Off light 1 White Light with Dimmer 2 White Light with Dimmer and Cold/Warm White 3 RGB Light 4 RGBW Light 5 RGBCW Light, RGB and Cold/Warm White To set the light, use ZbLight <device>,<nb_of_channels . Ex: ZbLight 0x1234,2 ZbLight Kitchen_Light,1 (see ZbName) Once a light is declared, Z2T will monitor any change made to the light via Z2T or via remotes, either from a direct message or via a group message. Z2T will then send a read command to the light, between 200ms and 1000ms later, and memorize the last value. To read the last known status of a light, use ZbLight <device> Example ZbLight Kitchen_Light MQT : stat /%topic%/ RESULT = { \"ZbLight\" :{ \"Kitchen_Light\" :{ \"Device\" : \"0x5ADF\" , \"Light\" : 2 , \"Power\" : 0 , \"Dimmer\" : 130 , \"Colormode\" : 2 , \"CT\" : 350 }}} Specific Device Configuration ~ If your device pairs successfully with Zigbee2Tasmota but doesn't report on standardised endpoints you will see messages similar to: {\"ZbReceived\":{\"0x099F\":{\"0500!00\":\"010000FF0000\",\"LinkQuality\":70}}} {\"ZbReceived\":{\"0x7596\":{\"0006!01\":\"\",\"LinkQuality\":65}}} In this case you will have to use rules or an external home automation solution to parse those messages. The following section will focus only on rules to utilize the device inside Tasmota ecosystem. <!-- ### Ikea ON/OFF Switch \"ModelId\":\"TRADFRI on/off switch\",\"Manufacturer\":\"IKEA of Sweden\" Short press O - 0006!00 Short press I - 0006!01 Long press O - 0008!01 Long press I - 0008!05 Long press release O or I - 0008!07 In this example Tradfri switch reports on 0x7596 and is used to control another Tasmota light device: Rule on ZbReceived # 0x7596 # 0006 ! 00 do publish cmnd /% topic %/ POWER OFF endon on ZbReceived # 0x7596 # 0006 ! 01 do publish cmnd /% topic %/ POWER ON endon on ZbReceived # 0x7596 # 0008 ! 01 do publish cmnd /% topic %/ Dimmer - endon on ZbReceived # 0x7596 # 0008 ! 05 do publish cmnd /% topic %/ Dimmer + endon ``` --> ### Aqara Water Leak Sensor ` \"ModelId\" : \"lumi.sensor_wleak.aq1\" ` In this example sensor reports on ` 0x099F ` and sends an mqtt message to topic ` stat / leak_sensor / LEAK ` : ``` haskell Rule on ZbReceived # 0x099F # 0500 ! 00 = 010000 FF0000 do publish stat / leak_sensor / LEAK ON endon on ZbReceived # 0x099F # 0500 ! 00 = 000000 FF0000 do publish stat / leak_sensor / LEAK OFF endon Aqara Vibration Sensor ~ \"ModelId\":\"lumi.vibration.aq1\" To modify sensor sensitivity use command. Replace \"device\" with your own device name: # for high sensitivity ZbSend { \"device\" : \"vibration\" , \"Endpoint\" : 1 , \"Cluster\" : 0 , \"Manuf\" : \"0x115F\" , \"Write\" : { \"0000/FF0D%20\" : \"0x01\" }} # for medium sensitivity ZbSend { \"device\" : \"vibration\" , \"Endpoint\" : 1 , \"Cluster\" : 0 , \"Manuf\" : \"0x115F\" , \"Write\" : { \"0000/FF0D%20\" : \"0x0B\" }} # for low sensitivity ZbSend { \"device\" : \"vibration\" , \"Endpoint\" : 1 , \"Cluster\" : 0 , \"Manuf\" : \"0x115F\" , \"Write\" : { \"0000/FF0D%20\" : \"0x15\" }} Command needs to be issued shortly after pressing the device button. There will be no response to the command but you can check if the new option is active by using ZbSend { \"Device\" : \"vibration\" , \"Endpoint\" : 1 , \"Cluster\" : 0 , \"Manuf\" : \"0x115F\" , \"Read\" : \"0xFF0D\" } Received response will be : { \"ZbReceived\" : { \"vibration\" : { \"Device\" : \"0x0B2D\" , \"Name\" : \"vibration\" , \"0000/FF0D\" : 1 , \"Endpoint\" : 1 , \"LinkQuality\" : 72 }}} \"0000/FF0D\" is the key, value 1 is high sensitivity, 11 medium and 21 is low. Zigbee2Tasmota Status Codes ~ You can inspect the log output to determine whether Zigbee2Tasmota started correctly. Zigbee2Tasmota sends several status messages to inform the MQTT host about initialization. {\"ZbState\":{\"Status\":1,\"Message\":\"CC2530 booted\",\"RestartReason\":\"Watchdog\",\"MajorRel\":2,\"MinorRel\":6}} Status contains a numeric code about the status message 0 : initialization complete, Zigbee2Tasmota is running normally 1 : booting 2 : resetting CC2530 configuration 3 : starting Zigbee coordinator 20 : disabling Permit Join 21 : allowing Permit Join for 60 seconds 22 : allowing Permit Join until next boot 30 : Zigbee device connects or reconnects 31 : Received Node Descriptor information for a Zigbee device 32 : Received the list of active endpoints for a Zigbee device 33 : Received the simple Descriptor with active ZCL clusters for a Zigbee device 50 : reporting CC2530 firmware version 51 : reporting CC2530 device information and associated devices 98 : error, unsupported CC2530 firmware 99 : general error, Zigbee2Tasmota was unable to start Message (optional) a human-readable message other fields depending on the message (e.g., Status= 50 or Status= 51 ) Zigbee Internals ~ If you want a more technical explanation on how all this works read Zigbee-Internals","title":"Zigbee"},{"location":"Zigbee/#hardware","text":"This integration works with Sonoff ZbBridge and any Texas Instruments CC2530x chip based device.

Zigbee2Tasmota will act as a coordinator. You can have multiple coordinators as long as they have different PanIDs. Wi-Fi Access Point PanID (Personal Area Network IDentifier) This parameter is unique in a Zigbee network (16-bit integer, 0x0000\u20130x3FFF). Default: 0x1A63 SSID (the Wi-Fi network name) ShortAddr Address of the device on the Zigbee network. This address is randomly assigned when the device first connects to the coordinator (16 bits integer, 0x0000\u20130xFFF7). The coordinator has address 0x0000. You need to track which device has which address or assign a \"Friendly Name\" to each new discovered device. IP address GroupAddr Group address of a collection of devices, it allows a single message to address multiple devices at once (16 bits integer, 0x0000\u20130xFFFF). For example a remote can turn on/off a group of lights. GroupAddr 0x0000 is not assigned. Multicast Endpoint The endpoint on the coordinator or on the Zigbee device the message is sent from/to. You can see endpoints as logical device providing distinct features (8 bits integer, 1\u2013240). IP Port IEEEAddr Device hardware address (64 bits). This is unique per device and factory assigned. MAC address Channel 11-26 Default: 11 (See Zigbee-Wifi coexistence ) Wi-Fi Channel Encryption Key 128-bit encryption key. default: 0x0D0C0A08060402000F0D0B0907050301 Wi-Fi password Pairing By default the coordinator does not accept new devices unless put in pairing mode. When in pairing mode, it will accept pairing requests from any device within range. Default: pairing disabled WPS Cluster Clusters are a group of commands and attributes that define what a device can do. Think of clusters as a group of actions by function. A device can support multiple clusters to do a whole variety of tasks. The majority of clusters are defined by the ZigBee Alliance and listed in the ZigBee Cluster Library","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Zigbee/#usage","text":"For a list of available commands see Zigbee Commands .","title":"Usage"},{"location":"Zigbee/#pairing-devices","text":"When you create a new Zigbee network, it contains no devices except the coordinator. The first step is to add devices to the network, which is called pairing . By default, and for security reasons, the Zigbee coordinator does not automatically accept new devices. To pair new devices, use ZbPermitJoin 1 . Once Zigbee2Tasmota is in pairing mode, put the Zigbee device into pairing mode. This is usually accomplished by pressing the button on the device for 5 seconds or more. To stop pairing, use ZbPermitJoin 0 .

Besides more than 400 other add-ons for all kinds of technologies, openHAB provides an MQTT add-on (\"binding\") to interface with systems like Tasmota. By following the guide below you'll be able to observe, control and manage your Tasmota modules from your openHAB system. If you are new to openHAB, please learn about the basic concepts and the initial setup. The below article will not cover any basics which are out of scope to the Tasmota integration.

MQTTv1 vs. MQTTv2 Binding Information Please note that since mqtt1 is a legacy binding for years now, it will no longer receive updates or fixes. See older version of this tutorial on how to integrate Tasmota using this binding if you are using mqtt1 - but be advised that it's not recommended anymore, it's better to upgrade to MQTTv2 binding. See openHAB announcement of MQTTv2 for details on how to change your configuration. MQTTv2 Integration ~ Configuration is split throughout some openHAB configuration files. First we need to set up a MQTT connection and Tasmota things - you will need a separate thing for every Tasmota device you use. In the example configuration you can see a non-default Full Topic definition. For your real world device simply set up items for all Tasmota MQTT topics you are interested in. Examples for most needed topics are given below, see section Discovering Interesting Topics below on how to watch the raw MQTT data. Some Tasmota topics are JSON encoded, the JSONPATH transformation can be used to extract this data. You'll need to replace the given example device topic name (e.g. \"Tasmota_TH\") by the one chosen for your module. .things File: Bridge mqtt : broker : myMQTTBroker \"My only one and best MQTT server\" [ host = \"IPofBroker\" , username = \"myUser\" , password = \"myPassword\" , clientID = \"myopenHABMQTTClient\" ] Thing mqtt : topic : tasmota : tasmota_TH \"Light_TH\" ( mqtt : broker : myMQTTBroker ) { Channels : // Sonoff Basic / Sonoff S20 Smart Socket (Read and switch on-state) Type switch : PowerSwitch [ stateTopic = \"stat/tasmota_TH/POWER\" , commandTopic = \"cmnd/tasmota_TH/POWER\" , on = \"ON\" , off = \"OFF\" ] // Sonoff Pow (read current wattage; for read and switch on-state see above) Type number : Power [ stateTopic = \"tele/tasmota_TH/SENSOR\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.ENERGY.Power\" } // devices including AM2301 temperature sensor Type number : Temperature [ stateTopic = \"tele/tasmota_TH/SENSOR\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.AM2301.Temperature\" ] // Tasmota Status Type string : Version [ stateTopic = \"stat/tasmota_TH/STATUS2\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.StatusFWR.Version\" ] Type switch : Reachable [ stateTopic = \"tele/tasmota_TH/LWT\" , transformationPattern = \"MAP:tasmota-reachable.map\" ] // Diagnostics: Define specific for what you really need on a regular basis, use standalone MQTT client for troubleshooting Type string : RestartReason [ stateTopic = \"tele/tasmota_TH/INFO3\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.RestartReason\" ] // old one, have to query it Type string : Version2 [ stateTopic = \"stat/tasmota_TH/STATUS2\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.StatusFWR.Version\" ] // new one - comes for free at startup Type string : Version [ stateTopic = \"tele/tasmota_TH/INFO1\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.Version\" ] Type number : RSSI [ stateTopic = \"tele/tasmota_TH/STATE\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.Wifi.RSSI\" ] Type string : WifiDowntime [ stateTopic = \"tele/tasmota_TH/STATE\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.Wifi.Downtime\" ] Type number : LoadAvg [ stateTopic = \"tele/tasmota_TH/STATE\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.LoadAvg\" ] Type number : Uptime [ stateTopic = \"tele/tasmota_TH/STATE\" , transformationPattern = \"JSONPATH:$.UptimeSec\" ] Type string : Result [ stateTopic = \"stat/tasmota_TH/RESULT\" ] } .items File: For every property your device exposes, you need to define an item, linked to corresponding channel of your Tasmota thing. // device specific properties Switch Switch_TH \"Switch_TH\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:PowerSwitch\" } Number : Temperature Switch_TH_Temp \"Temperature [%.1f \u00b0C]\" < temperature > { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:Temperature\" } Number : Power Power \"Power [%.1f W]\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:Power\" } // Tasmota Status String Tasmota_Version \"Tasmota Version [%s]\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:Version\" , channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:Version2\" } Switch Tasmota_Reachable \"Reachable\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:Reachable\" } // Diagnostics String Tasmota_RestartReason \"Restart Reason [%s]\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:RestartReason\" } Number : Dimensionless Tasmota_RSSI \"Signal [%d %%]\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:RSSI\" } String Tasmota_WifiDowntime \"Wifi Downtime [%s]\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:WifiDowntime\" } Number : Dimensionless Tasmota_LoadAvg \"Load [%d %%]\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:LoadAvg\" } String Tasmota_Result \"Result [%s]\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:Result\" } Number : Time Tasmota_Uptime \"Uptime [%.1f s]\" { channel = \"mqtt:topic:tasmota:tasmota_TH:Uptime\" } // Maintenance (described below) String Tasmota_Action \"Tasmota Action\" .sitemap File: // device specific properties Switch item = Switch_TH Text item = Switch_TH_Temp Text item = Power // Maintenance Switch item = Tasmota_Action mappings = [ restart = \"Restart\" , queryFW = \"Query FW\" , upgrade = \"Upgrade FW\" ] // Tasmota Status Text item = Tasmota_Version Text item = Tasmota_Reachable // Diagnostics Text item = Tasmota_RestartReason Text item = Tasmota_RSSI Text item = Tasmota_WifiDowntime Text item = Tasmota_LoadAvg Text item = Tasmota_Uptime label = \"Uptime [%.1f d]\" Text item = Tasmota_Result The \"LWT\" topic ( \"Last Will and Testament\" ) will receive regular \"Online\" messages by the module and an \"Offline\" message a short time after the module is disconnected, generated by the MQTT broker.

The following transformation file is needed: reachable.map F\u00edle: Online = ON Offline = OFF Maintenance Actions ~ A home automation system setup would not be complete without a certain maintenance automation! Add the following elements to your openHAB setup to be able to perform actions on your Tasmota devices by the press of a simple sitemap button.

Being able to compare it with the current release directly, is even better. You can archive this by combining the maintenance actions with the openHAB http binding, the JsonPath transformation and the GitHub API. Just extend the maintenance setup with the following Item and config: http.cfg: # Tasmota Release Version ( cached twice a day ) tasmotaRelease . url = https : //api.github.com/repos/arendst/Tasmota/tags tasmotaRelease . updateInterval = 43200000 tasmota.items: String Tasmota_Current_FW_Available \"Current Release [%s]\" { http = \"<[tasmotaRelease:10000:JSONPATH($[0].name)]\" } With this item in your sitemap, you will now see the latest release/tag from Tasmota repository.

These Single and Dual dimmer boards have open source firmware. Supported since version 6.4.0 as ARMTR Dimmer (56) Hardware ~ The dimmers contain an ESP8266 for the wifi connection and an Atmega328 which monitors the mains frequency and dimm the lights using a triac and phase controlled dimming. Communication between the two is done using the serial port at 115200 baud. The dimmers contain extra connections (pin headers) for a 10K potentiometer. When this one is connected you get 10 step dimming of the lights which overrides the tasmota dimm level. This feature also works when the Tasmota firmware is non-functional, so it is nice as a fail safe feature. The setting of the potentiometer is fed back to the Tasmota firmware, so when the potentiometer dimmer is turned and the Tasmota setting overridden, the value in the Tasmota channel is representable of the dimmer value. WARNINGS ~ Phase dimming is not for all lights. Most incandescent bulbs will work, but for LED and CCFL bulbs you will need the special dimmable versions of these lights. The large Blue/Yellow Swedish furniture store has some nice ones. Because these dimmers come in a small package, they lack a bit on the safety and interference side. A good idea would be to add a 1A fuse in the AC line and a R/C Snubber on the output. I also read somewhere that they work less well on 110VAC but this could probably be solved using a firmware update. The ESP8266 and Atmega are isolated from Mains. The used 220v-5V converter is the tried and tested HiLink 5V 0.6A PM01, but without the case. Software ~ For now, to use these dimmers you need to take it apart and flash new firmware to the ESP8266 and the Atmega328p using the Arduino IDE. The whole process is quite well documented for the single and dual dimmers. But you do need a USB to serial bridge, at best one with the DTR and RTS signals broken out as well. The software can be found in two Github repositories, for the single and dual dimmer. The Armtronix dimmer can be used in the Tasmota firmware by uncommenting the line #define USE_ARMTRONIX_DIMMERS in my_user_config.h and setting the module to ARMTR Dimmer. The Dual dimmer has a dual color led, which for now shows the wifi status of the Tasmota firmware.

MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE IT PLUGGED IN WHEN DOING ANY OF THIS INCLUDING FLASHING - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. AS ALWAYS, YOU DO ANY OF THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Overview ~ The UK version of the BW SHP works perfectly as module number 45 (BlitzWolf SHP) but is challenging to flash with Tasmota firmware for two reasons: The case is glued; this is relatively easy to overcome as you can insert a very thin screwdriver into the case then simply slide it all the way around the perimeter to free off the glue. A much bigger issue is that the programming pins for the esp8266 are underneath the PCB very close to the case, so there's no way to get to them easily. This is the biggest challenge to installing Tasmota. There are three choices here: Open the case, unsolder the main PCB from the live and neutral pins. This is very difficult to do without deforming the plastic protection on the pins themselves and needs a powerful soldering iron. Open the case, bend the main PCB up from the case. I've done one this way and it's possible, but not ideal as the copper live and neutral bars could crack from fatigue. In either of these two methods, you also have to glue the case back together before the plug is safe to use, otherwise if you try and pull it out of a socket the cover simply comes off, exposing all the mains potentials. Make a slot in the bottom of the case, exposing the programming pins. This is my recommended way of doing it because it doesn't risk damaging the case or having it come apart from improper gluing, nor does it potentially fatigue the power pins or deform their safety plastic. However it does leave a big hole in the bottom of the case! That said, the hole is only accessible when the plug is not in a socket and you can always cover it with more plastic later. Holes in the base method ~ If you want to go for method 3 ie hole in the base, this is where they should be. There's a better picture of this area of the PCB further down this page on a version I removed from its case. Opening the case ~ If you really feel a need to open the case - not recommended - get something very thin and fairly strong, push it into the base and pry a little until it goes in 3-4 millimetres. Then slowly rotate the plug with the wedge held in the opening so you end up pushing the top of the case away from the base all the way around. Once you're done, this is what you'll find inside. Gently pull the white shutter mechanism upwards and off the copper pins - it comes away very smoothly and easily but be careful to hold upright so the little spring doesn't pop out and disappear. To get at the programming pins you then either have to desolder the live and neutral from the PCB and lift the whole thing off - strongly recommend you don't do this as you will almost certainly deform the plastic protecting the pins - or you will need to bend the PCB gently upwards so you can get at the underside. If you do that it will look like this..... It's then pretty easy to flash using the pin connections I've annotated on the drawing - make sure you power it from low voltage though - DON'T EVER CONNECT TO THE MAINS TO FLASH OR WHEN CASE IS OPEN. Once done, bend the PCB back into place, pop the white shutter assembly back on top and put the two case halves together with strong glue. MAKE SURE THE GLUE IS WELL HELD AS OTHERWISE WHEN YOU PULL THE PLUG OUT OF A SOCKET THE TOP COULD COME OFF, EXPOSING ALL THE LIVE CONNECTIONS. This is why I DON'T recommend opening the case to flash the firmware but instead suggest cutting a slot in the base and cover it afterwards.","title":"BlitzWolf BW SHP4 UK Version"},{"location":"devices/BlitzWolf-BW-SHP4-UK-Version/#serial-connection","text":"Please see the Hardware Preparation page for general instructions.

It measures 118mm wide by 72mm high, irrespective of the number of buttons, although it is also available in 86x86mm. The tempered glass front plate is available in white, black and gold colors. Despite it being advertised as a 'US' device, it will handle 90-250V AC input at 50/60Hz and is said to switch up to 10A per circuit. The same design is also available for use with a RF-remote, or as a traditional wall switch. There is a backlight indicator behind each button, which subtly shows green when the circuit is live and red when it is not. When physically pushing the button, there is an audio feedback. See here to view a video of the audio feedback. The one interesting for Tasmota is of course the WiFi version, which connects to 2.4GHz networks, up to 802.11n. The switch comes pre-loaded with ITEAD software and works well with the EWeLink app. Inside ~ When opening the package, easily done by turning a screwdriver under the two plastic lips at the lower side of the switch, the first thing we see are the capacitive touch sensors mounted on the back of the low-voltage board. The low-voltage board is connected through a 14-pin connector to the mains board, and contains an ESP8285 , piezo buzzer (should you wish to remove that audio feedback!) and a number of additional components. The ESP8285 is of course compatible with the ESP8266 albeit with only 1MB flash storage. The mains-voltage board contains the mains connection points, a TI ULN2003A relay driver and 1-3 relays and a tiny little board containing a power supply for the low-voltage bits. Flashing ~ The most interesting part is of course how we flash this device with Tasmota. To do this, do not connect the device to mains power and carefully remove the low-voltage board as this is all you'll need. Notice the 4 connection points just above the ESP8285, which is where you'll connect (from square pad up) 3v3, RX, TX and GND. I found that normal DuPont jumper wires provide a secure enough connection, but you may wish to solder on a few header pins. In order to get the ESP8285 into programming mode, you'll also need to connect GPIO0 to GND. There is no easily accessible connection point for GPIO0 and no buttons are provided on the board. I found the easiest way is to just use a normal jumper cable and manually hold it up against pin 10 (GPIO0) for a few seconds while the power is connected to the chip. Pin 10 is the second pin of the 'pin 9-16' row, on the right hand side of the chip in the image above. Use the usual method for flashing, undoubtedly documented better elsewhere than I ever could.

On AliExpress you can buy a wifi dimmer for mains voltage (110 or 220V) It's a brandles dimmer, but can be found here: AliExpress page It comes in a couple of forms, but sinds I live in Holland, I chose the EU style, single gang, 220V, White edition. It has a glass front plate with 3 proximity/touch switches (On/Off, dimm up & dimm down) and a wifi indicator LED. The inside houses 2 PCB's; a power board and a control board: The control board: There are two main chips on board: An ESP8266 and a Nuvoton n76e003at20 The Nuvoton will do the switch side of it all, the ESP communication. The mains board: For flashing, we only need the control board. Solder small wires to the pads as marked on the picture: 3.3V GND RX TX Sw (gpio0) Solder 'Res1' to GND Note that the silkscreen on this board has TX and RX wrong. Now use a USB to serial adapter to connect the wires. Use a 3.3V board, NOT 5V, this will destroy the ESP chip on the board! Connect: GND to GND 3.3V to 3.3V RX to RX (due to the fact the silkscreen is wrong, otherwise, RX connects to TX and vice versa) TX to TX SW to GND -- only during power up, to put the ESP in programming mode. From here the upload is the same as for all other Tasmota devices. See the upload page for detailed info. Note: sonoff basic and classic variants do not support the serial bridge. To get this working you should use the standard tasmota.bin - NOT basic or classic. After the upload was successful, unplug the device from the serial adapter. You can now desolder all the connections you have made earlier. Also remove the wire between RES1 and GND. Then plug the board back in its housing. Be careful with the connector on the underside of the board. Line up the pins with te header and lightly press it in its place. Connecting to mains installation: ~ WARNING!

An easy soldering method is to take several Dupont style jumper wires, cut one end off, and apply a bit of solder to each stripped end. This will keep the wire flexible and prevent any circuit board pads from ripping off. Apply a bit of solder to each pad necessary to flash (double check your pin-outs). Once the wire and pad have solder simply put the two together and apply a bit of heat and they will join together. Attach the GPIO0 wire to ground during initial boot to flash. A 3-pin header bridged together works great with GPIO0, GND and the GND from the USB flasher attached (TX pin to RX pin and RX pin to TX pin on USB flash adapter). Verify that you are using 3.3volts to flash, NOT 5V! Two options: Remove the ESP PCB by desoldering. This makes it easier to get to the pins of the TYWE3S board. No PCB desoldering. You will have to connect the RESET pin of the MCU chip to GND. This requires a soldering iron with a thin tip.

To place the board into flashing mode, you will need to short J3. This can remain shorted while flashing is in progress, but you will need to remove the short in order to boot the Tasmota firmware. First Boot ~ Most boards supported by the Tasmota firmware use GPIO 1 for serial TX. The H801, as shown in the image above, uses GPIO 2. As the serial RX is still the same as for other boards, it is possible for Tasmota to read from the serial connection but anything written will not be sent to your terminal.

If you only have 512kB of flash, you can still build your own firmware, but will have to remove components that you do not need, in order to reduce the size of the firmware binary.

As an added bonus, the device also provides energy monitoring functions (voltage, current, power) in much the same way as the Sonoff Pow module does. As you may have guessed, its 'smarts' come from an embedded ESP8266, which makes it a potential target for the excellent sonoff-tasmota code. This guide provides details on how to prepare the socket for the initial flashing with sonoff-tasmota code. What is it? ~ This smart socket comes with its own iPhone/Android App and is controllable from the HF Smart cloud service. As well as allowing on/off control, the plug/socket also measures current, voltage and power. It\u2019s pretty well made but almost certainly doesn\u2019t meet the full British electrical standards, as it doesn\u2019t have a shutter to close off the live socket holes when a plug is removed. This a rather a shame and would not be too tricky to implement and would only marginally increase the cost of these pretty cheap (~\u00a3UK 10) units. The provided software/service all seemed rather closed and proprietary and not able to talk to other stuff. So something had to change! The Name ~ I'm mostly calling this a 'Smart Socket' but it also is called a 'Smart Plug' in some places. As it's got both, I guess both are right. \ufffc Disassembly ~ * WARNING - Opening the unit potentially exposes mains voltages that can kill. You proceed beyond here entirely at your own risk. * There are no screws; to disassemble you need to prise it open on each side. \ufffcInside there is a main board with most of the components on the reverse. The Wi-Fi and control comes from a small daughter board, soldered to the main board.\ufffc There\u2019s not a lot to see on the top apart from the mains relay, the button and the red/blue LEDs that illuminate it.\ufffc The main item of interest on the top is the daughter board. This has our trusty ESP8266EX and a 8Mbit SPI flash memory. You can also see the 40MHz crystal - more on this later\u2026 \ufffc The reverse of the daughter board is pretty bare - only the Vcc (3.3V) and GND are marked. In this view you can also see the red and blue LEDs and the push button. In its original configuration the red LED normally is set to the same state as the relay and the blue LED provides information on the state of connectivity. Another warning... What is marked as GND IS NOT GROUNDED , it\u2019s not even floating, GND IS CONNECTED TO THE NEUTRAL LINE OF THE MAINS . Do not connect any equipment or yourself to the board whilst it is plugged onto a mains socket - EVEN IF THAT SOCKET APPEARS TO BE SWITCHED OFF. Neutral is not 0V or Ground and should be treated as live (just in case it really is). Always completely disconnect your programming / serial interface before plugging the device into a mains socket. You need a hefty soldering iron to unsolder the board from the plug pins and on the reverse you see the main circuitry. Next door to the AMS1117 3.3V regulator for the ESP is a HLW8012 chip that does the current/voltage/power measurement. Conveniently, this is the same chip that's used in the Sonoff Pow module, so all the code to drive it is already in place. Below the two ICs is R12 it's R002 i.e. a 2mOhm resistor. This may be different to the one in the Sonoff, so expect to use different calibration settings. Hookup ~ Unless you are just curious, there\u2019s no real need to unsolder the main board. You can get at everything you need to re-flash it on the top side of the main board. \ufffc For programming you need to unplug the unit for any mains and make connections to GND, Vcc and Rx. That\u2019s 1, 2 and 4 on the back of the daughter board, counting from the right. The connection for Tx should have been on the back of the daughter board (all the circuit board tracks are in place on the daughter board). However, for some reason they didn\u2019t populate R5 (or removed it after programming) so the Tx signal does not appear on the rear of the board like it was clearly designed to do. Instead you have two options, either re-instate R5 with a very small piece of wire (or a teeny resistor if you have one) or solder a wire directly to the resistor pad/chip pin. As the connection should be temporary (subsequent flashes will be Over the Air) I initially went for the simpler but more fragile direct connection, mechanically secured with some insulating tape. If you do prefer to solder a small wire across R5 then you will need to cut the small links on the main board around pad 5, as the designers of the main board have connected this pad to the GND plane with two small links, one at the end and to the left side of the pad. Again, all this is on the top of the main board, you don\u2019t need to go delving underneath. On the front of the daughter board there is the GPIO0 pin (pad number 4, reading from the left). This needs to be manually connected to ground and then the power applied to the ESP8266 to put it in programming mode. You can solder something onto this, as shown, or pick it up where it connects to the blue LED with a small clip probe.

So if soldering isn't your bag, there are a few connection points that you can get at with clip probes. There is a +5V and GND contact on the left side of the board and the right LED legs give access to the ESP's GPIO0 and RXD. The tricky bit is the ESP's TXD line which, as stated before, is only accessible on the daughter board via the chip's pin or an smd pad above and to the right. @jwrw, I am in awe of anyone that can solder onto this pad! As an alternative, try connecting an alligator clip to a sewing pin 8) to make a probe and holding it in place with your finger during firmware programming (hey, it only has to work once as from then on you use OTA). Powering via the pcb contacts requires more current than my FTDI was able to source so a seperate 5V power supply is required (a Raspberry Pi can provide the +5V/GND via it's GPIO header if you haven't got a dedicated power supply at hand). Building Firmware ~ The process for building the firmware for the HuaFan is basically the same as for the Sonoff but with a few additional steps. Firstly, make sure that you have installed release 5.5.0 of Tasmota or later and that you have completed all of the standard preparation tasks mentioned in the Wiki. Next, you should ensure that you have installed version 2.4.0-rc1 or later of ESP8266/Arduino core that includes support for the 40MHz crystal used by the HuaFan. Installation instructions can be found here but are essentially as follows: - Start Arduino and open Preferences window. - Swap the existing link for the stable ESP8266/Arduino core release with https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/releases/download/2.4.0-rc1/package_esp8266com_index.json in Additional Board Manager URLs field.. - Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and update esp8266 platform (check that it is using the RC version). Lastly, you need to edit the boards.txt file to allow selection of the 40MHz Crystal via the Arduino IDE Tools menu. Add the following lines into the section for the \"Generic ESP8266 Module\" and immediately after the \"generic.menu.CpuFrequency\" items: generic.menu.CrystalFreq.26=26 MHz` generic.menu.CrystalFreq.40=40 MHz` generic.menu.CrystalFreq.40.build.extra_flags=-DF_CRYSTAL=40000000","title":"The Huafan Wi-Fi Wireless Smart Socket/Plug."},{"location":"devices/HuaFan-Smart-Socket/#the-huafan-wi-fi-wireless-smart-socketplug","text":"","title":"The Huafan Wi-Fi Wireless Smart Socket/Plug."},{"location":"devices/HuaFan-Smart-Socket/#introduction","text":"The HuaFan Wireless Wifi Smart Plug/Socket is a useful bit of kit that allows you to introduce home automation without getting into any mains re-wiring.

This was in fact the smallest smart plug device with UK plug I've ever seen - it is no bigger than an average USB/phone charger: Another good thing is that it is built around a ESP8266 module, which gives us the possibility to change its firmware and install Tasmota. Open the case ~ There are no visible screws, however it is not that difficult to open the case using some sharp plastic or metal pry tool and a heat gun (or hair dryer on max setting also works - hold on each side for about 20-30 seconds). Heat the edge of the plug a bit, then work your way slowly and pry from the middle of side with the button, slowly moving the tool towards the corners. Alternatively if you don't have a heat gun or hair dryer you can use a pry tool or something else thin to slowly \"saw\" away at the middle of the side with the button until you are through (about 2-3mm) . With or without a heat gun/hair drier it can be quite tough - be careful and keep your fingers away from the tool you are using! Once you have got through the layer of adhesive you can lever the case open to dislodge the adhesive on the other sides. Be careful not to accidentally knock off the PCB supports in each corner as these are crucial to safety. Once the case is open, the top side of the PCB will be exposed: The WiFi module is soldered vertically to the main PCB and sits right next to the relay. In order to get access to its pins, remove the screw from the centre of the PCB. After that the bottom plastic plate, which holds the three mains connector prongs, can be moved a bit to the side without desoldering anything (it is attached with short cables to the PCB, but cables' length is just enough to move it out of the way of the WiFi module's pins). Here's a view of the bottom side of the PCB: You can see the product labels (product code, date and board revision), as well as the UL number. WiFi module pins ~ Here is a close-up view of the module's pins as seen from the bottom of the main PCB: And this is how module pins numbers are mapped (I had to desolder the module looking for labels when I tried to identify it): Failed to identify the module, I had remove the metal shielding cap to find the routing of the ESP8266's pins, so I grabbed the multimeter and soon I had the following table: Module pin ESP8266 pin Pin name Pin name ESP8266 pin Module pin 1 7 Chip Enable Tout (ADC) 6 2 3 9 MTMS / GPIO14 MTDI / GPIO12 10 4 5 12 MTCK / GPIO13 MTDO / GPIO15 13 6 7 15 GPIO0 GPIO2 14 8 9 16 GPIO4 GPIO5 24 10 11 25 U0RXD U0TXD 26 12 13 Vdd - - GND 14 Serial Connection ~ For programming you need to solder 4 jumper wires to pins 11 , 12 , 13 and 14 : Pin Function 11 Rx 12 Tx 13 Vdd 14 Ground In this picture Yellow is Tx, Orange is Ground, Grey is Rx and White is Vdd: Connect the other end of the wires to your USB-to-serial adapter and make sure the supply voltage selected is 3.3V. Shorting pin 7 (GPIO0) to ground while plugging the serial adapter into the computer's USB port will bring the module into UART firmware upload mode. See devices/Esptool for details of how to flash the firmware when in firmware upload mode. Once you have flashed the firmware, leave the jumpers soldered to the pins and unplug & reinsert your USB-to-serial adapter - this will reset the unit and provide voltage to the ESP8266 which will then boot the new Tasmota firmware - you'll see a Wifi network called \"sonof-xxxx\" if it has flashed successfully worked (if you do not see the wifi, the flashing process might not have worked correctly and you'll need to try again). If you see the wifi network come up ok, you can de-solder the jumpers and reassemble the unit. Reassembly ~ Screw the PCB back to the housing, and place the PCB back into the other half of the socket. Apply a small 1mm bead of super glue around the edges and firmly clip the two halves back together again, and hold firmly for about 30 seconds to allow the glue to cure. Dangerous Failure Mode To Avoid ~ When reassembling the plug, be extremely careful to ensure that the resistor next to the PCB screw is not leaning towards the earth (top) pin! It is very easy to slightly bend it towards the earth pin when unscrewing. If the resistor is too close to the earth pin, the plastic shield for the earth pin on the upper-half of the case will press the resistor down onto the earth pin and when a plug is inserted it can short-out and trigger a small explosion: This will kill the socket, and maybe you too. Take extreme caution - mains electricity is dangerous. If you cannot neatly clip everything back into place (i.e. the two halves of the shell don't neatly sit together again, or there is a springiness) then you may have caught the resistor. If you accidentally broke off the PCB standoffs when opening the case, this is harder to detect (as the PCB may be pushed further down than usual) so be especially careful. Double & triple check. If you've done everything right you should have a fairly clean looking plug still with just a small amount of cosmetic scratches on the bottom side of the unit where you used the pry tool. Configuration ~ Enroll your plug back onto your wifi as usual for Tasmota (i.e. join the wifi network started by the plug, give it your wifi details, then restart it). Once Tasmota 's WebUI configuration interface is loaded in the browser, you need to configure the template type: Go to \"Configuration\" Go to \"Configure template\" Create a new template that looks like this one and save it: Once you have saved the template: Wait for the device to restart Go to \"Configuration\" Go to \"Configure module\" Select the new template you just created and save. Note on LEDs ~ Sonoff devices usually have a bi-colour LED, but just one of the colours can be controlled directly. The other colour is usually tied together with the relay, so it cannot be controlled independently. I think that is the reason why the Tasmota firmware by default controls just Led1 when a single relay is configured. In the configuration above, only the blue LED will be used (tied to GPIO2 ). But if you prefer the red LED, just change the values for Led1i and Led2i (select Led1i for GPIO0 and Led2i for GPIO2 ). Additional Details ~ If you want to read a detailed project log that uses this plug, you can do so at GitHub Blog page , although some of the information is now out of date.","title":"Hyleton 313 Smart Plug"},{"location":"devices/Hyleton-313-Smart-Plug/#intro","text":"Recently I bought a very nice and compact Smart Plug (UK variant) from Aliexpress - a Hyleton 313 .

Module is powered by 12V that is used to power LED strip as well. RGB models are declared as 144W, RGBW models as 192W. Module comes in (at least) 3 variants: - LC01: RGB, - LC02: RGBW and - LC03: RGB with IR receiver. - LC04: RGBW with IR receiver. - LC05: RGB with Screw-Headers. - LC06: RGBW/WW with Screw-Headers A different version of this controller with an ESP8285 is documented here Serial Connection ~ Board has RX, TX, GND and GPIO00 pads exposed on the bottom side of the PCB. You need to solder temporary wires those pads. You need to power the board while keeping it connected to the programmer. With all Sonoff boards that work with AC, this is a big no-no that will fry your programmer, your Sonoff and might even get you killed. In this case, you'd be dealing with 12V, so the only thing that matters is to connect the GND of your programmer to GND of the board before you supply the 12V. Not doing so might fry your board and/or programmer, but would definitely not hurt you. Steps used: 1. Connect your programmer to a breadboard and notice the locations of GND, TX and RX columns. 1. Open the MagicHome controller box and expose bottom side of PCB 1. Solder 4 jumper wires to 4 exposed pads. 1. FIRST connect GND to your programmer (and make sure they are connected well!) 1. Connect RX from the MagicHome to TX on the programmer. TX from the board goes to RX on the programmer. 1. Connect GPIO00 to GND (best to use same column on the breadboard) 1. Connect the 12V power supply to MagicHome. As GPIO00 is connected to GND, board will go into flash mode. Disconnect GPIO00 after few seconds. 1. Upload Tasmota like it would be any other board. 1. Once upload is complete, disconnect power from the MagicHome controller 1. Disconnect RX and TX and then only then GND. GND gets disconnected LAST. You can then connect the power back to the board and Tasmota should be running on it. Once you verify that board is up and you can access it over the Web, you can unsolder temporary wires and update subsequent firmware versions using OTA. Configuration ~ Some GPIO are preconfigured with the board: - GPIO05 - (PWM2) Green color on the led strip, first pin from the GND - GPIO14 - (PWM1) Red color on the LED strip, second pin from the GND - GPIO12 - (PWM3) Blue color on the LED strip, third pin from the GND For instructions to setup the 24 Button Remote visit the AL-LC04 device page Check this for Board Version 2.3 : #1867 Due to variants, you can configure: - GPIO04 - on non-IR boards, it's an open pin you can use for Onewire, button or something else. It might have pull-down resistor and/or bypass capacitor, so please take that into consideration. On IR-enabled boards, IR receiver is connected to this pin, so you can use IRRecv as functionality. - GPIO13 - This pin is not used on RGB board (so you'll leave it as \"None\"), but on RGBW, it's driving another channel (cold white or warm white) for LED strip. Variant without Rx/Tx pads: ~ - Using the IRrecv (IR Remote) feature ~ If you have a variant with an IR Remote (as per the opening picture), you can use the new rule command to make the remote buttons change the light levels.

With all Sonoff boards that work with AC, this is a big no-no that will fry your programmer, your Sonoff and might even get you killed. In this case, you'd be dealing with 12V, so the only thing that matters is to connect the GND of your programmer to GND of the board before you supply the 12V. Not doing so might fry your board and/or programmer, but would definitely not hurt you. Steps used: 1. Connect your programmer to a breadboard and notice the locations of GND, TX and RX columns. 1. Open the MagicHome controller box and expose bottom side of PCB 1. Solder 4 jumper wires to 4 exposed pads. 1. FIRST connect GND to your programmer (and make sure they are connected well!) 1. Connect RX from the MagicHome to TX on the programmer. TX from the board goes to RX on the programmer. 1. Connect GPIO00 to GND (best to use same column on the breadboard) 1. Connect the 12V power supply to MagicHome. As GPIO00 is connected to GND, board will go into flash mode. Disconnect GPIO00 after few seconds. 1. Upload Tasmota like it would be any other board. 1. Once upload is complete, disconnect power from the MagicHome controller 1. Disconnect RX and TX and then only then GND. GND gets disconnected LAST. You can then connect the power back to the board and Tasmota should be running on it. Once you verify that board is up and you can access it over the Web, you can unsolder temporary wires and update subsequent firmware versions using OTA.","title":"Serial Connection"},{"location":"devices/MagicHome-LED-strip-controller/#configuration","text":"Some GPIO are preconfigured with the board: - GPIO05 - (PWM2) Green color on the led strip, first pin from the GND - GPIO14 - (PWM1) Red color on the LED strip, second pin from the GND - GPIO12 - (PWM3) Blue color on the LED strip, third pin from the GND For instructions to setup the 24 Button Remote visit the AL-LC04 device page Check this for Board Version 2.3 : #1867 Due to variants, you can configure: - GPIO04 - on non-IR boards, it's an open pin you can use for Onewire, button or something else.

It\u2019s likely there\u2019s an ADC receiver on the other side receiving our variable voltage on the purple wire above and converting that to the AC dimmer signal. When probing with the oscilloscope I noticed a 3.3v 1Khz square wave on GPIO13. It turns out this is the PWM that controls the output of the purple wire. This is done using the positive duty cycle of the wave. Here\u2019s a state table: Setting Duty 1 (Min Setting) 20% Duty 2 40% Duty 3 60% Duty 4 80% Duty 5 (Max Setting) 100% Duty, constant 3.3v We should be able to generate this same wave with whatever duty cycle we want in Tasmota to get much better dimming resolution than the default firmware provides. The buttons are tied as follows: Button Description UP1 GPIO0 to GROUND when pushed DOWN1 TXD to GROUND when pushed ON/OFF 3.3v to GPIO15 when pushed RESET Wired through an LED and resistor to GPIO16, also goes to white wire (RESET for the STC?), ties to GROUND The LEDs are wired as follows: LED Description LED1 Passthrough to RESET, GPIO16, see above. LED2 GPIO14 LED3 GPIO12 LED4 GPIO5 LED5 RXD Added a new entry to the sonoff_template.h list and assigned all the pins. You can of course just do a generic load and set it up with the Web UI. Here's what I ended up with in the header: { \"MJ-SD01\" , // Martin Jerry Smart Dimmer Switch (ESP8266EX) GPIO_SWT3 , // GPIO00 UP1 Button, bright up GPIO_SWT2 , // GPIO01 Serial TXD and DOWN1 Button, bright down 0 , // GPIO02 GPIO_REL5 , // GPIO03 Serial RXD GPIO_REL1_INV , // GPIO04 Multi-LED RED GPIO_REL4_INV , // GPIO05 LED1 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , // GPIO06-GPIO11 GPIO_REL3_INV , // GPIO12 LED3 GPIO_PWM1 , // GPIO13 PWM for dimmer GPIO_REL2_INV , // GPIO14 LED2 GPIO_SWT1 , // GPIO15 ON/OFF Button, ties to 3.3v when pushed GPIO_SWT4 , // GPIO16 RESET button, also goes to AC side and probably resets the STC chip, tied to LED1 0 // ADC0 Analog input } FADE ON: Makes the PWM movements smooth DIMMER +/-: Moves dimmer up and down SPEED 3: Slows down fade a little SETOPTION15 1: Sets DIMMER mode rather than PWM Now that you can have rules set on dimmer actions, changing the LEDs with dimmer settings should be easy. I tried to do this before that existed, and it wasn't possible.","title":"Info on the Tuya"},{"location":"devices/Mirabella-Genio-Bulb/","text":"Mirabella Genio Bulb ~ Mirabella have released a few smart bulbs. Here is a bit of a guide on how to flash them with Tasmota. There are two ways: Over the Air (OTA) or via Serial. Flashing Over the Air ~ Flashing over the air requires running a linux shell script called tuya-convert and hence requires a computer (I used a Raspberry PI 3) with a wifi adaptor that supports AP mode. There are options if you run Windows to use either a virtual machine (it is reported that KALI Linux running on VMWare has worked) or potentially a live usb (I haven't tested it). Follow this procedure . To get the bulb into config mode, have the bulb on for at least 10 seconds, then cycle it off and on 3 times via a physical light switch. The bulb should flash rapidly when its in config mode. Tasmota v6.4.1 basic build is included as part of the tuya-convert script. It will open an WiFi access point named sonoff-XXX on the bulb once flashed correctly. Flashing via Serial ~ Flashing via Serial requires disassembling the bulb and soldiering wires to the board. Note: modifying these bulbs is dangerous if you do not understand what you are doing, please do so at your own risk! Mirabella Bulbs Disassembling bulb ~ The 2 main outer parts of the bulb are stuck together with high temp silicone or something similar. Squeeze the outer of the bulb (the bit that looks like glass) as near to the join as possible, you can use a tool like a spudger or something if that helps to break the seal, being careful not to damage any internal parts or cut yourself! Once the outer (fake glass) is removed you will see this: Carefully cut / scrape away as much of the sealent on the outer edge of the round circut board then using some needle nose pliers and your spudger pry the round board out. If you are really good at soldering and have a fine tip on your iron you could possibly skip this step and jump straight to the next one. B22 Stand the bulb up and de-solder the 2 pads, and straighten the wires to remove the board. E27 Using a sharp strong blade carefully pry out the small terminal on the end of the bulb then straighten the wire in side This will allow you to pull the board out a little and get enough angle on it to make soldering easier. You should now have these parts (E27 bulb will be still partly assembled): B22 E27 (with wires added) Connect FTDI ~ Connect your FTDI up to these pins: Flash with your preferred method I use this one (remember to connect GPIO0 to GND when plugging in your FTDI this will force the ESP into firmware write mode, you may need to try it a couple of times.

In effect the power needed to engage the relay is too low. Replacing the Yellow Capacitor often solves the problem. I have several of these lying around and they can be used very well with sonoff functionality. As the sonoff PCA is a bit too large I decided to design my own PCA using kicad. During Proof of Concept I used 5V power supplies from itead. After three units were built one crashed caused by debris on the PS PCA resulting in an AC short which in turn blew the large resistor. As the selected Songle relay has the control leads close to the AC leads I also changed the relay. I decided to select the HiLink 5V power supply as it was also favourable on other sites. The relay now has the same connections as the one used in sonoff.

DO NOT CONNECT ANY SENSOR TO THESE DEVICES. Only use them as designed. AS ALWAYS, YOU DO ANY OF THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Device case is glued so recommended way to flash it is using tuya-convert This method worked for 3 devices that were shipped before December 2019, never paired with Tuya apps and never powered on near open WiFi APs. So they had no chance to download Tuya-Convert updates. It may not work for devices with newer firmware. Prerequisites ~ You'll need a Linux device with both WiFi capable of running in AP mode and ethernet connection Clone/download tuya-convert Run install_prereq.sh Ubuntu only On Ubuntu, it's also necessary to temporary disable WiFi from Network Manager and stop/disable systemd-resolved. Edit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and add [keyfile] unmanaged-devices = interface-name:wlp2s0 Replace wlp2s0 with your WiFi interface name if neccessary. Then run sudo systemctl restart network-manager.service sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service Don't forget to undo everything after flashing, DNS and WiFi won't work otherwise. Start flashing ~ Run start_flash.sh and follow the instructions Connect any WiFi device to vtrust-flash AP when it asks to and make sure that it gets an IP address. If it doesn't stop and check logs in scripts folder for clues Connect socket to mains and long-press the button to enter pairing mode Tasmota is included with tuya-convert, follow script's instruction to flash it After flashing device should reboot and you should see Tasmota's WiFi AP (Sonoff-xxx). Run stop_flash.sh to shutdown vtrust-flash AP on a machine you used for OTA. Configuration ~ Connect to Tasmota's AP It's extremely important to enter correct WiFi configuration. Button is not on GPIO0 so won't do anything for default Sonoff Basic device profile. It's recommended to temporary enter second WiFi with something easy like SSID: TEST Password: testtest so you could start that AP and re-configure the device if there are any issues with main WiFi connection. After it reboots and successfully connects to WiFi configure it as Blizwolf SHP module Now button and relay should work. Red and Blue LEDs will be used as status LEDs. RGB Light ~ Use this template to configure the device: {\"NAME\":\"RGB Smart Plug\",\"GPIO\":[37,0,39,0,38,134,0,0,131,17,132,21,0],\"FLAG\":0,\"BASE\":45} For older versions: Complete RGB support requires building slightly custom Tasmota.

After it reboots configure as following: [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Astr0/Sonoff-Tasmota/images/lonsonho16a/config.png|Configuration]] RGB and dimming should work now. Disassembling the device ~ This is not recommended. Do it only if you have to or just buy a new one. The device is hard to open and may be damaged. Components inside may have mains charge and electrocute you even if powered off. Do it at your own risk. One of my devices had a hardware issue - constantly losing WiFi, rebooted when wiggled in power socket, rebooted every few seconds on 1250W load, sometimes just hanged and not responded even to the button. Since it wasn't usable at all I tried to fix it. The reason was broken steel input pole inside(what?? how?? WTF??) that was making weak contact, couldn't fix it reliably. Unbend earth connections on the bottom to make them straight. Use a sharp knife to slice through glue between RGB ring and the case. Requires quite a lot of force and time. RGB ring may break in places where glue is stronger than the plastic. Use a screwdriver to pry the case open. Remove button cap Desolder output connections, try not to melt any plastic. Remove support plastic with a screwdriver, it's held to the PCB by two clips. Desolder input poles. This is tricky since there's a lot of solder. I've removed as much of it as possible with desoldering pump, then melted the solder and rotated the poles with pliers while it cooled. Poles are made of steel and steel don't accept solder well. Remove the PCB by lifting it up. It's glued to the case on the bottom by the relay and held tight with input poles so it requires some force. Also, it's not easy to grab the PCB. I've used dip removing tweezers, holding PCB by holes for the earth connectors. I figured out the pinout for flashing the device: Before assembling it back remove as much solder as possible from input and output pole pads. The device fits together very tight, so everything should be perfectly in place. Don't forget to glue the case back. Alternative to disasselmy: Drilling two holes. ~ _With all this information at hand it is also possible to drill two simple holes into the case to get to the necesarry contact pads. I recommend a 6mm drill, carfully drill trough the case at he center of the ledge from the high power side opposite the power button. See pictures. Now you can solder on a few temporary flash cables. Don't forget to pull IO0 to GND to get into flash mode. Few observations: * It has ESP8266EX with FM25F08 8Mbit flash. The module has lots of connections, some of them have only pads without tracks on the main board. High chances to find RX and TX there.

With stock firmware special modes are supported (stand-alone schedules, inching, interlocking). RF receiver (optional key fob or Sonoff RF Bridge 433 required). Dual microcontroller, both a ESP8285 and a STM32. Serial Flashing ~ Sonoff 4CH Pro ~ The \"FW/IO0\" button (Switch 1) is not directly connected to GPIO0 of the ESP module. A different method has to be used to program this board. To program the ESP chip disconnect power from the board, connect a cable from any Ground (GND) pin to the GPIO0 pin on the ESP (be careful not to touch any of the other pins). This is the second pin to the right on the top row of pins (see picture). While holding the pin connected power on the board. The board does not respond to any button pressed when in programming mode and LED 1, 2 and 3 are on (might differ per board). Use the ESP programming header as described in the picture to upload the firmware and follow regular programming procedure. Sonoff 4CH Pro R2 ~ On the R2 module the GPIO0 pin is broken out to a small pad to the right of the ESP package : If you have 4CH R2 v1.0 hardware, the GPIO0 is available as L1 switch - you don't need to solder additional cable to the PCB. Just push it during powering on for 3 seconds and release. Solving Sonoff 4CH Pro programing issues ~ If you have problems to program the 4CH Pro, you might find below tips useful: * Use the ESP program header and ensure that the right port is set in the Arduino IDE. * TX/RX are printed correctly on the pro version => TX goes to RX PIN and RX to TX. * GPIO0 needs to be connected to ground the first 3 seconds during reboot (or longer)! If not you can not program it. * On 4CH Pro R2 try switch S6 to 0 before connecting power to enter flash mode. Reset to 1 (default) after finished flashing. If you use Windows7+, check in the device manager if the port is not added/removed all 2 seconds. If yes then your USB port does not deliver enough ampere. And/Or reduce upload speed to 57600 in Arduino IDE.

Alternative GPIO locations Programming the Sonoff Dual is more difficult because the on-board-button is not connected to GPIO0. As with all ESP8266 modules pulling GPIO0 to GND is needed to put the chip in programming mode. You need to connect GPIO0 and GND during power up. GND can be found on all three headers. GPIO0 can be accessed in two ways: 1. Unscrew the Sonoff Dual from the housing and access the underside of the PCB. You can find GPIO0 on one side of a resistor as shown in the second image. 2. GPIO0 can be found on the small inter layer via pointed at in the first image.

It is used to send and receive codes with 433.9MHz frequency RF devices. Codes received from RF devices such as remote controls is passed to the onboard ESP8285 via the serial interface. The code data is relayed via MQTT. Similarly, the Bridge receives commands over Wi-Fi and sends the encoded data to the RF chip to control an RF device. Thus, the Sonoff RF Bridge \"bridges\" communications between RF and Wi-Fi. Flash Tasmota ~ Please Hardware Preparation article for general flashing instructions. Access the serial interface available on the 5-pin header next to the switch as can be seen in the image. To flash the ESP8285, first move the switch position towards the 5-pin header. Connect the serial-to-USB adapter and press the button on the edge while powering the device in order to put the ESP8285 into programming mode in order to upload the Tasmota firmware. After flashing the ESP8285, be sure to move the switch position away from the 5-pin header to restore the connection to the RF microcontroller. Configure the device as usual and select module Sonoff Bridge (25) . During normal operation the serial interface is used at 19200 baud to communicate with the RF microcontroller. Therefore serial logging ( SerialLog 0 ) must be disabled. IMPORTANT: In the Module configuration GPIO4 and GPIO5 must be left as 00 None On R2 versions of the Sonoff RF Bridge, a hardware modification is required in order to use these GPIOs. Video tutorial by alsolh ~ RF Firmware ~ The RF chip has its own firmware. The device is shipped with Itead firmware which supports a limited set of RF devices limited to mostly just Sonoff devices (a single 24-bit RF protocol). Some later versions of the factory firmware will only relay received RF data once the transmitting device stops. This is fine for remote controls or devices such as door sensors. But for devices such as smoke detectors, this behavior is not acceptable. Custom firmware is available for the RF chip which is commonly referred to as 'Portisch'. By updating the firmware on the RF chip, new types of devices and new features become usable. It also relays the RF data when the data is received rather than waiting until the transmitter stops. Tasmota supports the original Sonoff RF firmware and the Portisch firmware . RF Firmware Upgrade ~ The RF upgrade requires wiring the bridge and then flashing the firmware via the Tasmota web UI. **Attention \u26a0\ufe0f\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\ufe0f There are 2 versions of the Sonoff RF Bridge 433 : the R1 and the R2 V1.0 . R1 R2 V1.0 RF firmware flashing: Hardware Preparation This section applies only to the R2 revision of the Sonoff RF Bridge Apply this modification only if you intend to use USB for powering the device during flash process or if you want to use GPIO4 or GPIO5 for other purposes with the RF Bridge. The R2 revision boards connect the GPIO4 and GPIO5 pins to the USB data lines of the power connector. Compliant USB chargers/power supplies are expected to short the two pins together, which is a problem. These lines are not used by the original firmware, nor by Tasmota. The traces toward the USB power connector need to be cut to avoid interference by the USB wiring. Removing these connections does not interfere with the normal Bridge functionality. Flashing RF Firmware Make sure you have previously flashed a Tasmota binary built with RF_FLASH . Refer to the builds table for pre-compiled binaries which include this feature. Otherwise the \"Magic byte is not 0xE9\" error will occur. Set the module type to Sonoff Bridge (25) Connect two wires (this will be different depending on the Sonoff RF Bridge 433 hardware version): For R1 : Connect GPIO4 to C2Ck and GPIO5 to C2D . For R2 : Connect GPIO4 to C2D and GPIO5 to C2Ck . ( The text on the R2 PCB silkscreen is switched. Therefore this is the same wiring as on the R1) Switch the ON/OFF switch on the board to 'ON'. Power up the bridge via the 3.3V & GND pins. (See below if you need to power the device through the USB power port) Obtain the Portisch firmware file: (Clicking on the file link on the GitHub web site does not work since this will download the GitHub preview/content of the file rather than the raw file contents) Download the entire contents of the Tasmota GitHub project project via the green Clone or Download button to ensure that the firmware hex files are downloaded properly. The firmware files are located in the ./tools/fw_efm8bb1/ folder. Select the newest available hex file. Otherwise you may get error \"Magic byte is not 0xE9\" . As an alternative use wget/curl to download the raw file (https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/tree/master/tools/fw_efm8bb1) directly. Select the newest available hex file. Otherwise you may get error \"Magic byte is not 0xE9\" . PowerShell example: wget https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/raw/master/tools/fw_efm8bb1/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1-XXXXXXXX.hex -OutFile .\\RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1-XXXXXXXX.hex Go to the Web UI Firmware Upgrade > Upgrade by File Upload (introduced in v6.0.0a) In the file selection dialog, navigate to the folder on your computer where you saved the hex file from step 6. Click Start Upgrade . The flashing should complete within 60 seconds. Device will restart after upgrade completes. Disconnect wiring and put the ON/OFF switch on the board back to 'ON' to enable the RF again. Operation ~ The Sonoff RF Bridge is able to learn up to 16 different fixed code remote control commands as provided by PT2260, PT2262, PT2264 and EV1527 transmitters. It was not able to recognize the latest Klik Aan Klik Uit (KaKu) remote control signals but some people managed to use the fixed code KaKu devices like PAR-1000 receiver and PAT-103 transmitter. Tasmota provides default remote control commands to all 16 keys so you can start using the bridge with a Sonoff 4Ch Pro or Sonoff RF device without having the bridge have to learn remote control commands. See RF Bridge commands. Portisch Firmware Specific Usage ~ These sections only apply to the custom Portisch firmware. Learning Commands with Portisch Firmware ~ In order to learn Buttons from your remote, go to the Console of your RF Bridge. There, enter rfraw 177 and push the buttons on your remote. Repeat each button 2-3 times, as the signal may be different for each try. This will give you a so called B1 code of your button, which needs to be converted to a B0 code (see below). Sending Commands with Portisch Firmware ~ The commands learned with Portisch Firmware cannot be stored in device memory. Instead, they must be sent as a command. Example using MQTT: cmnd/sonoffRFBridge/Backlog RfRaw AAB0210314016703F924180101011001100110010101100110011001010110010101100255; RfRaw 0 Refer to issue #3973 for further information. B1 to B0 Conversion Tools ~ After learning how bitbucket works from the Portisch wiki , use one of these tools to help convert received B1 sniffing messages to the right 'B0' format to send in the 'RfRaw' command.

The circuit board didn't match either/any of the tutorial for getting the original or V2 devices into programming mode. Though it's labeled \"V2\", the cluster of resistors/capacitors around the CPU is different; in particular the resistor at the position indicated by many of the tutorials as labelled r9 , is instead labelled r18 . There does seem to be a trace attached to the GPIO0 pin on the CPU but it leads to a dead end (perhaps a via to the other side of the board). After much screwing around, I discovered that simply holding the button while I connected to the four header pins and powered it on put it into programming mode. I flashed it from a mac terminal window like so: esptool . py -- port / dev / tty . usbserial - A60226NF write_flash - fs 1 MB - fm dout 0x0 ~/ Downloads / tasmota . bin The barcode on the box for the device that I received is 6920075757361, it's also labeled with MPN:IM190528001. I purchased the device from Amazon, it was titled SONOFF Slampher R2 433MHz RF&WiFi Smart Lamp Bulb Holder for Smart Home, Compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant and was at this URL: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TRSYJGB","title":"Sonoff Slampher"},{"location":"devices/Sonoff-T1/","text":"Sonoff-T1 seems to be an evolution of Sonoff Touch and exists in one, two or three button variations and contains a 433MHz receiver. Based on the ESP8285, but using a Silabs EFM8BB1 microcontroller to extend the number of IOs needed to control 3 buttons, with separate relays and LEDs together with the radio. SYN470R is used as 433Mhz Radio. The chip for touch is unlabeled. EFM8BB1 Data Sheet ESP8285 Data Sheet SYN470R Data Sheet Read before flashing ~ Tasmota has functionality to perform special actions on multiple button presses and long press for 40 seconds resets firmware to default. This will cause the T1 board to reset if relay board is not connected, because long press on Button1 will be detected. To avoid this, use command SetOption13 1 immediately after flashing Tasmota. When powered solely with 3.3v from the serial-to-USB adapter long press will be detected by Tasmota on Button1. When powered solely with 3.3v from the serial-to-USB adapter RF functions do not work. If you can't flash succesfully lower the baud rate, most likely to 74880 . Serial Flashing ~ Sonoff T1 UK ~ The front circuit board should be disconnected from the rear relay board to prevent power draw upsetting the flashing process. The unit must be powered up before attempting to enter programming mode. If touch Button1 is held while power is connected, the device will not go enter flash mode. The touch IC does not have time to recognise the key-press before the device boots. Touch Board VER:1 ~ The following board layouts are from the 3 variants of the Sonoff T1 UK variant and are marked Sonoff T1 R2 UK Touch Board, Ver 1.0. Entering Flashing mode varies between the 1, 2 and 3 channel versions. See the above picture for button nomenclature used. (The variations between the 3 versions appear to be managed by the touch IC rather than in the ESP). To enter flashing mode the unit should be powered and connected to the programmer of choice. Touch Button 1 should then be held while the reset button (4) is pressed. When the device reboots, Button 1 can be released. OR Double-press the reset-button Try option 1 OR option 2. This will cause the unit to reboot into flash mode. This is confirmed on a serial console (74880 baud) by the boot mode displaying (1,x) indicating that we are booted to the bootloader and not the flash. You can also confirm booted to flash without a serial console, the main led should be off and the backlight LEDs lit dimly. There is no longer a need to solder anything to GPIO0 or to ground it while powering up for Ver1.0; this step is replaced by the above button sequence. However, GPIO0 to GND is the only way for Ver1.1 boards. Touch Board Ver:1.1 ~ Notes: 1. There is not enough room with this version to solder header pins to the programming port and still close the case. One possibility is to slightly bend the pins of a 4-way header and push it into the holes, removing it after programming. 2. GPIO0 is connected to the helper chip on this version, so the only way to get Ver1.1 of the board into flash mode is to solder a lead onto the resistor R19 from pin 15 on the ESP chip (GPIO0) and connect this lead to GND on power up; the device will set all the touch pads to dim and the WiFi LED D3 will NOT be on at all. 3. The connection marked 'LOG' on the J3 header is GPIO2. WARNING!! Do not attempt to power the device from your serial-to-USB adapter when connected to the relay board. This draws too much power and will cause the ESP to reboot frequently and reset all the configured settings. Sonoff T1 EU ~ For most devices, the UK version flashing guide may work. Sonoff T1 EU 1CH (2018-06-04) ~ All the flashing pins are in the front top right corner (sorry about covering them with the wires). From top to bottom: - LOG (GPIO2 not used) - GND - TXD - RXD - VCC To flash simply connect GND, TXD, RXD, and VCC as any regular ESP. Hold the touch button, press reset at once, then it boots into flash mode (no blinking WiFi LED, dimmed touch button). If this does not work, try shorting R19 to GND as shown in \"Touch Board VER:1.1\" * Stock baud rate: 74880 * Relay pin: 0 Sonoff T1 EU 2CH (v1.0) ~ For 2 Channel board version 1.0 , you need to solder (or otherwise permanently connect) GPIO0 (R19) to GND before powering the board and only disconnect them once the flashing is complete. After having connected GPIO0 and GND, power the board - it will boot directly to flashing mode. Flash your firmware and disconnect the board. Sonoff T1 EU 3CH (2018-10-03) ~ There are two pin headers (J1 and J3) and no reset button. J3 is used for flashing. GPIO0 is exposed on the back as test point (TP2/GPIO0). Connecting it to any ground such as the ground from J1 when powering up puts the ESP8255 into flash mode. Baud rate for flashing is 74880. Sonoff T1 US ~ It appears that SonOTA may work again with Sonoff firmware v2.0.1 or greater . This needs to be verified for this specific device. To get it working you can simply plug it to mains, once it's powered up, press and hold the button that's closer to the Wi-Fi logo (you'll hear a beep sound). Keep holding it until you hear that beep for the second time. Now let go. The Wi-Fi light should blink in pairs of 3. Now repeat the procedure (Press and hold until you hear the beep 2 times). Now you should be seeing the Wi-Fi logo flashing rapidly. You can proceed to try and flash with SonOTA now. US Model of 3-button T1, received direct from Sonoff China 2018-05-12 ~ Front photo (Google photos) Rear photo (Google photos) (Sorry about the tape smudges). The header labels on J3 are accurate (apparently some boards have TX and RX reversed; this doesn't seem to suffer that). Flashed with SonOTA . Above method of getting into flash mode doesn't seem to work. UPDATE: I did flash it with the FTDI method. To put then in flash mode press 2 times quickly the internal switch S1. UPDATE 2: Confirmed by another user that flashed with SonOTA works as described on \"Preparing\" Sonoff T1 US 3 Gang ~ The jump-wire method to enter the flash mode: * Jump the wire as attached picture * While keeping the wire connected then plug the serial-to-USB adapter to the computer * Wait for 1 to 2 seconds then release the jump-wire * You can start flashing the Sonoff T1 US 3C. Sonoff TX US 2/3 Gang ~ The PCB layout for the TX/T0 model (vertical, black or white face-plate with squared-off, LED-lit buttons) is different again from the original T1. There is no TP2/GPIO0 test point on the back of the PCB and R19 has moved. The basic instructions for flashing the T1 (with a USB adapter) still work. ~ It seems that Sonoff is trying to seal off the ESP using some glue see image: 433MHz remote ~ The Tasmota firmware is compatible with the RF remote feature built in to the T1 modules. Pairing a new remote is the same procedure as a stock Sonoff, i.e., hold the desired button on your sonoff until you are given 1 beep (approx 7 seconds), press the button on your RF remote. The Sonoff will beep to confirm the pairing. To unpair a remote, press until you are given 2 beeps, press the button on your RF remote. The Sonoff will beep to confirm the unpairing. Circuit ~ ESP8285 GPIO0 EFM8BB1 P1,3 Switch 1 input (Goes low when first touch button is pressed) GPIO04 is connected to the small (soft) reset button on the front. GPIO09 EFM8BB1 P1,4 - Switch 3 input (Goes low when third touch button is pressed) GPIO10 EFM8BB1 P1,5 - Switch 2 input GPIO13 is connected to status LED D3. GPIO12 Relay 1 GPIO5 Relay 2 GPIO4 Relay 3 GPIO2 is connected on J3 pin 5 (LOG) On the EFM8BB1 (QFN20 package) P0,0 Relay 1 P0,1 Relay 2 P0,2 Relay 3 P0,3 Button 1 P0,4 Button 2 P0,5 Button 3 P0,6 SYN470R Data Out P0,7 Buzzer P1,0 Led button 1 P1,1 Led button 2 P1,2 Led button 3 P1,3 ESP8285 GPIO0 P1,4 ESP8285 GPIO09 P1,5 ESP8285 GPIO10 P1,6 ESP8285 EXT_RSTB (RESET) Ghost Switching ~ Some of these devices are prone to hardware ghost switching. You may need to experiment with ButtonDebounce and SetOption40 to reduce or eliminate these issues. Also, during the flashing process, you may have soldered a lead to GPIO0 in order to connect it to GND for putting the ESP into programming mode. If there are any random oscillations on GPIO0, this can trigger the relay. The contacts on the PCB are very close together. Check that you don't have any stray solder to another contact. Even if there isn't contact, over time heat and humidity can cause any residual flux to become resistive and allow conductivity. Be sure to clean everything after removing any leads. Known so far ~ When pushing a button, the touch chip lift the power high to the EFM8BB1, and the EFM8BB1 chip ties the signal line for each button low, for the full duration of the keypress. Debouncing is not needed. 433MHz remotes are compatible with the Tasmota firmware DO NOT attempt to power the device from your programmer when connected to the relay board. This draws too much power and will cause the ESP to reboot frequently and will reset all the configured settings. The relays state can be set on the GPIO's 12, 5 and 4. The switch status can be read on GPIO's 0, 10 and 9. Push button active low. Unknown so far ~ Where GPIO15 is connected? Over R18 10kOhm pull-down only?

GPIO0 is connected to the helper chip on this version, so the only way to get Ver1.1 of the board into flash mode is to solder a lead onto the resistor R19 from pin 15 on the ESP chip (GPIO0) and connect this lead to GND on power up; the device will set all the touch pads to dim and the WiFi LED D3 will NOT be on at all. 3. The connection marked 'LOG' on the J3 header is GPIO2. WARNING!! Do not attempt to power the device from your serial-to-USB adapter when connected to the relay board. This draws too much power and will cause the ESP to reboot frequently and reset all the configured settings.","title":"Touch Board Ver:1.1"},{"location":"devices/Sonoff-T1/#sonoff-t1-eu","text":"For most devices, the UK version flashing guide may work.","title":"Sonoff T1 EU"},{"location":"devices/Sonoff-T1/#sonoff-t1-eu-1ch-2018-06-04","text":"All the flashing pins are in the front top right corner (sorry about covering them with the wires).

Flashing using only a USB to serial converter will not work as the unit draws too much current as can be observed by a flashing blue led on the PCA and a lot of serial gibberish. As AC is not connected to Gnd I used the available power supply of the unit and connecting the USB to serial converter to J3 pins Gnd, Tx and Rx. The button is not connected to GPIO0 so flashing the unit requires some extra work. I managed to flash the iFan02 by soldering a wire to TP16 (GPIO00) on the bottom of the PCA. Keep this wire connected to Gnd during the power-on or reset process (pressing the button) and the unit will be in firmware upgrade mode. If you've soldered the gpio0 connection don't forget to unsolder before booting normally. Connect RX -> TX | 3.3 -> 3.3 | TX -> RX | GND -> GND and connect TP16 to GND (as used in the TTL). Press and hold the button while connecting to power. If you have an Arduino you may be able to flash without providing an additional power source. I have successfully flashed using an Arduino Duemilanove with the atmel chip pulled out (basically using it for FTDI and 3.3v power regulation). Rx on Arduino goes to Rx on iFan02, Tx to Tx (no crossover like with FTDI). I did not have to press the button, only to ground TP16 while initiating the flash in Arduino IDE. The Arduino provides enough power to flash, however it will not boot into Tasmota unless you plug in to external power (it boot loops after flashing is complete).

Flashing using only a USB to serial converter will not work as the unit draws too much current as can be observed by a flashing blue led on the PCA and a lot of serial gibberish. As AC is not connected to Gnd I used the available power supply of the unit and connecting the USB to serial converter to J3 pins Gnd, Tx and Rx. The button is not connected to GPIO0 so flashing the unit requires some extra work. I managed to flash the iFan02 by soldering a wire to TP16 (GPIO00) on the bottom of the PCA. Keep this wire connected to Gnd during the power-on or reset process (pressing the button) and the unit will be in firmware upgrade mode. If you've soldered the gpio0 connection don't forget to unsolder before booting normally. Connect RX -> TX | 3.3 -> 3.3 | TX -> RX | GND -> GND and connect TP16 to GND (as used in the TTL). Press and hold the button while connecting to power. If you have an Arduino you may be able to flash without providing an additional power source. I have successfully flashed using an Arduino Duemilanove with the atmel chip pulled out (basically using it for FTDI and 3.3v power regulation). Rx on Arduino goes to Rx on iFan02, Tx to Tx (no crossover like with FTDI). I did not have to press the button, only to ground TP16 while initiating the flash in Arduino IDE. The Arduino provides enough power to flash, however it will not boot into Tasmota unless you plug in to external power (it boot loops after flashing is complete).","title":"Serial Flashing"},{"location":"devices/Sonoff-iFan02/#additonal-information","text":"See issue #2839 for user information See issue #3412 light on after restore power Functioning iFan02 in Tasmota WebUI iFan02 PCA with TP16 Two users report the TP16 pad lifting after soldering a wire to ground as shown in picture.

Connect the other end of the wires to your USB-to-serial adapter and make sure the supply voltage selected is 3.3V. Shorting pin 7 (GPIO0) to ground while plugging the serial adapter into the computer's USB port will bring the module into UART firmware upload mode. Configuration ~ Once Tasmota 's WebUI configuration interface is loaded in the browser, you can change many settings using the menu options. Console window is where you can change almost all configuration parameters. Head straight to the Configure Module menu, selected 'Generic' for 'Module type' . Here are the settings that I selected on that screen: Sonoff devices usually have a bi-colour LED, but just one of the colours can be controlled directly. The other colour is usually tied together with the relay, so it cannot be controlled independently. I think that is the reason why the Tasmota firmware by default controls just Led1 when a single relay is configured. In the configuration above, only the blue LED will be used (tied to GPIO2 ). But if you prefer the red LED, just change the values for Led1i and Led2i (select Led1i for GPIO0 and Led2i for GPIO2 ). end quote if you care led 2 is blue and led 1 is red I flashed the standard tasmota.bin file to it with out any problems with both the esptools and with arduino the one benefit to using arduino is that I was able to configure my wifi in advance I hope to update this and clean it up but I thought I should get it up here as I found nothing about this plug before I forget to post and I can't remember any details. Note: I have a newer version of this, labelled C7 HYS-X5-SOCKET_V1.2. The connectors for the ESP8266 board seem different. Still mapping them, but beware of following these instructions unless you know you have the same version. Update: looks like I actually destroyed the ESP8266 board somehow, using the software-only tuya-convert technique.

Console window is where you can change almost all configuration parameters. Head straight to the Configure Module menu, selected 'Generic' for 'Module type' . Here are the settings that I selected on that screen: Sonoff devices usually have a bi-colour LED, but just one of the colours can be controlled directly. The other colour is usually tied together with the relay, so it cannot be controlled independently. I think that is the reason why the Tasmota firmware by default controls just Led1 when a single relay is configured. In the configuration above, only the blue LED will be used (tied to GPIO2 ). But if you prefer the red LED, just change the values for Led1i and Led2i (select Led1i for GPIO0 and Led2i for GPIO2 ). end quote if you care led 2 is blue and led 1 is red I flashed the standard tasmota.bin file to it with out any problems with both the esptools and with arduino the one benefit to using arduino is that I was able to configure my wifi in advance I hope to update this and clean it up but I thought I should get it up here as I found nothing about this plug before I forget to post and I can't remember any details. Note: I have a newer version of this, labelled C7 HYS-X5-SOCKET_V1.2. The connectors for the ESP8266 board seem different. Still mapping them, but beware of following these instructions unless you know you have the same version.

One of them has ESP8266MOD chip (by AI-THINKER), other one has ESP-12F chip (by TUYA L/N 0026). Both are actually same chips and are flashed the same way. You need to solder 5 wires: 1. VCC (3.3V) 2. GND (GROUND) 3. Rx 4. Tx 5. GPIO0 To put this chips into flash mode, we need to jump wire GPIO0 and GROUND, before you plug your USB adapter into computer. Release jump wire after couple of seconds. Red LED (bottom one) should slightly lit up. Now you can start flashing process. When flashing process is complete, you can unplug USB adapter. Your TUYA smart plug is TASMOTIZED. THIS IS OPTIONAL!!! You can now use Termite app, to load your router WiFi SSID and password using below commands: (just copy and paste all of it, but put your details in). In Termite settings, check your COM number, where adapter is plugged in and select 115200. Backlog SSID1 YOUR_SSID_NAME; Password1 YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD; MqttHost MQTT_INTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS; MqttUser MQTT_USER_NAME; MqttPassword MQTT_PASSWORD; GPIO2 56; GPIO12 21; GPIO13 17 After that, Termite should tell you, what IP address was assigned to your smart plug. Put that IP address in your browser and you should see Tasmota GUI. Go into Configuration > Configure Module > Change to Generic (and click Save). After restart, go into Configuration > Configure Module and change GPIO's as on screen below. You can change between D4 GPIO2 56 LED1i and D4 GPIO2 52 LED1 (Blue led on when device is on, or blue led on when device is off) That's it, now your smart plug will flash both red and blue leds and smart plug button should respond to presses.

Unfortunately I bricked one of my plugs (probably by typing wrong Wifi name), so I needed to flash manually.

I soldered pins on and bent them down to get everything back in the case. To open, 4 screws are under the soft foot pads. They take a size 2.0 triangle bit; make sure you have a large collection of small screwdriver bits around. The programming header is directly on the Tuya module and is silkscreened with the labels for the pins. Solder onto those and program just like any other Tuya. There's unfortunately no button to get into firmware mode that I could find, so you have to ground the pin yourself. If you're using an external power source for the board and another power source for your TXD/RXD, make sure to tie the grounds together or else it won't talk. I burned on the generic tasmota release and set it up like so: Relays 1-3 are the AC plugs Relays 4,5 are the USBs The button only turns off the first AC by default, but you could write rules to do whatever you want.","title":"Be Aware"},{"location":"devices/meross-MSS425/#be-aware","text":"There are different versions of this power strip.
